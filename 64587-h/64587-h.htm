  <h2 id='ch01' class='c009'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>No apology for writing this book. An imperative duty under
present conditions. Description of my parents and their
personal appearances. Description of Mon Repos, Angela
Gardens. Long anxiety prior to my birth. Intense joy
when at last this takes place. My father’s decision as to
my Xtian name. Early selection of my first godfather.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>It</span> is customary, I have noticed, in publishing
an autobiography to preface it with some sort
of apology. But there are times, and surely the
present is one of them, when to do so is manifestly
unnecessary. In an age when every
standard of decent conduct has either been torn
down or is threatened with destruction; when
every newspaper is daily reporting scenes of
violence, divorce, and arson; when quite young
girls smoke cigarettes and even, I am assured,
sometimes cigars; when mature women, the
mothers of unhappy children, enter the sea in
one-piece bathing-costumes; and when married
men, the heads of households, prefer the flicker
of the cinematograph to the Athanasian Creed—then
it is obviously a task, not to be justifiably
avoided, to place some higher example before the
world.</p>

<p class='c014'>For some time—I am now forty-seven—I had
been feeling this with increasing urgency. And
when not only my wife and her four sisters, but
the vicar of my parish, the Reverend Simeon
Whey, approached me with the same suggestion,
I felt that delay would amount to sin. That
sin, by many persons, is now lightly regarded,
I am, of course, only too well aware. That
its very existence is denied by others is a fact
equally familiar to me. But I am not one of
them. On every ground I am an unflinching
opponent of sin. I have continually rebuked
it in others. I have strictly refrained from it
in myself. And for that reason alone I have
deemed it incumbent upon me to issue this
volume.</p>

<p class='c014'>A glance at the frontispiece will show me as I
appeared at the age of twenty-one. But I propose
in the first instance to deal with my earliest
surroundings and the influence exerted upon me
by my father. Believing as I do that every man
(and to a lesser extent every woman) is almost
entirely the product of his or her personal
endeavours, I cannot pretend, of course, to
attach much importance to merely paternal
influence. Nevertheless in the lives of each one
of us it undoubtedly plays a certain part. And
although my father had numerous faults, as I
afterwards discovered and was able to point out
to him, he yet brought to bear on me the full
force of a frequently noble character.</p>

<p class='c014'>That such was his duty I do not of course
deny. But duty well done is rare enough to
deserve a tribute. And in days such as these,
when fatherhood is so lightly regarded, and is so
frequently, indeed, accidental, too much attention
can surely not be given to so opposite an
instance.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the time of my birth, then, and until his
death, my father was a civic official in a responsible
position, being a collector of outstanding
accounts for the Consolidated Water Board. In
addition, he was one of the most respected and
trustworthy agents of the Durham and West
Hartlepool Fire and Burglary Insurance Company,
a sidesman of the Church of St. James-the-Less
in Camberwell, and the tenant of Mon
Repos, Angela Gardens. This was one of some
thirty-six admirably conceived houses of a
similar and richly ornamented architecture, the
front door of each being flanked and surmounted
by diamond-shaped panes of blue and
vermilion glass; and though it was true that
this particular house had been named by the
landlord in a foreign tongue, it must not be
assumed that this nomenclature in any way met
with my father’s approval. On the contrary,
he had not only protested, but such was his
distrust of French morality that he had always
insisted, both for himself and others, upon a
strictly English pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Somewhat under lower middle height, my
father, even as a boy, had been inclined to
corpulence, a characteristic, inherited by myself,
that he succeeded in retaining to the end of his
life. Nor did he ever lose—or not to any
marked extent—either the abundant hair that
grew upon his scalp, his glossy and luxurious
moustache, or his extraordinarily powerful voice.
This was a deep bass that in moments of emotion
became suddenly converted into a high falsetto,
and he never hesitated, in a cause that he deemed
righteous, to employ it to its full capacity.
Always highly coloured, and the fortunate
possessor of an exceptionally large and well-modelled
nose, my father’s eyes were of a singularly
pale, unwinking blue, while in his massive
ears, with their boldly outstanding rims, resided
the rare faculty of independent motion.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother, on the other hand, presented
hardly a feature that could, in the strictest sense,
have been called beautiful, although she was
somewhat taller than my father, with eyes that
were similar in their shade of blue. Like my
father’s, too, her nose was large, but it had been
built on lines that were altogether weaker, and
the slightly reddish down upon her upper lip
might even by some people have been considered
a disfigurement. She had inherited, however,
together with five hundred pounds, an apparently
gentle disposition, and was a scion or
scioness of the Walworth Road branch of the
great family of Robinson. Herself the eldest
of the nine daughters of Mortimer Robinson, a
well-known provision merchant, my father had
claimed relationship for her, albeit unsuccessfully,
with Peter Robinson of Oxford Street,
while he used half humorously to assert her connection
with the fictional character known as
Robinson Crusoe. Clean in her habits, quiet
about the house, and invariably obedient to his
slightest wish, he had very seldom indeed, as
he often told me, seriously regretted his choice
of a wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>With sufficient capital, therefore, not only to
furnish his house, but to pay its first year’s
rent and establish an emergency fund, my father
might well have been supposed by an ignorant
observer to be free from every anxiety. Such
was not the case, however, and he was obliged,
almost immediately, to face one of the sternest
ordeals of his married life. Ardently desiring
increase, it was not for nine and a half months
that Providence saw fit to answer his prayers,
and as week succeeded week and the cradle still
remained empty, only his unfaltering faith saved
him from despair. But the hour came at last,
and so vividly has my father described it to me
that I have long since shared its triumphant joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Born at half-past three on a February morning,
the world having been decked with a slight
snow-fall, it was then that my mother’s aunt,
Mrs. Emily Smith, opened the bedroom door
and emerged on the landing. My father had
gone outside to lean over the gate, and was still
leaning there when she opened the door, but my
mother’s mother, with another of my mother’s
aunts, were standing with bowed heads at the
foot of the stairs. Prone in the parlour, and
stretched in uneasy attitudes, five of her eight
sisters were snatching a troubled sleep, while two
fellow-members of my mother’s Mothers’ Guild
were upon their knees in the back kitchen.
But for the fact, indeed, that two of my mother’s
sisters had not, at that time, had their tonsils
removed, the whole house would have been
wrapped in the profoundest stillness.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother’s mother was the first to see Mrs.
Smith, though she only saw her, as it were,
through a mist. Mrs. Smith was the first to
speak, in a voice tremulous with emotion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s Augustus?” she said. Augustus
was my father’s name.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s just gone outside,” said my mother’s
mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>Something splashed heavily on the hall
linoleum. It was a drop of moisture from Mrs.
Smith’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell him,” she said, “that he’s the father of
a son.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother’s mother gave a great cry. My
father was beside her in a single leap. Always,
as I have said, highly coloured, his face at this
moment seemed literally on fire. The two
fellow-members of my mother’s Mothers’ Guild,
accompanied by my father’s five sisters-in-law,
rushed into the hall. Mrs. Smith leaned over
the banisters.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A boy,” she said. “It’s a boy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A boy?” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, a boy,” said Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a moment’s hush, and then Nature
had its way. My father unashamedly burst into
tears. My mother’s mother kissed him on the
neck just as the two fellow-members burst into
a hymn; and a moment later, my mother’s five
sisters burst simultaneously into the doxology.
Then my father recovered himself and held up
his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall call him Augustus,” he said, “after
myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Or tin?” suggested my mother’s mother.
“What about calling him tin, after the saint?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you mean—tin?” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Augus-tin,” said Mrs. Emily Smith.</p>

<p class='c014'>But my father shook his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, it shall be tus,” he said. “Tus is better
than tin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then his five sisters-in-law resumed the singing,
from which the two fellow-members had
been unable to desist, until my father, who had
been rapidly thinking, once again held up his
hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And I shall give the vicar,” he said, “the
first opportunity of becoming Augustus’s godfather.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he took a deep breath, threw back his
shoulders, tilted his chin, and closed his eyes;
and with the full vigour of his immense voice, he
too joined in the doxology.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Trials of my infancy. Varieties of indigestion. I suffer from
a local erythema. Instance of my father’s unselfishness.
Difficulty in providing a second godfather. Unexpected
solution of the problem. The ceremony of my baptism.
A narrow escape. Was it culpable carelessness? My
father transfers his worship to St. James-the-Lesser-Still,
Peckham Rye.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>With</span> the portion of my life that intervened
between my birth and my baptism I do not
propose, owing to exigencies of space, to deal
in the fullest detail. But it may be of some
comfort to weaker fellow-sufferers to be assured
that, from the outset, the ill-health to which I
have been a life-long martyr played its part in
testing my character. Singularly well formed,
of a sanguine complexion, and weighing not less
than four and three-quarter pounds, Providence
saw fit almost immediately to purge me without
medicinal aid. Whether this was due, under
Higher Supervision, as my father several times
forcibly suggested to her, to some dietary excess
or indiscretion on the part of my mother was
never determined. But the fact remained that
for several weeks I suffered from indigestion in
two main directions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twice indeed, on the grounds of health, the
ceremony of my baptism had to be postponed;
and for hours together, I have been told, I lay
upon my back, with my knees drawn up and
my fingers clenched, in an anguished endeavour
to stifle the moans that I was too enfeebled
wholly to suppress. Time after time, too, my
mother’s mother, the aunt that had stood with
her at the bottom of the stairs, and various of
my mother’s sisters would recommend alternative
forms of nourishment. But although, at
my father’s desire, each of these suggestions was
given an immediate trial, it was not for two
months, and until I had been subjected to a
heart-breaking period of starvation, that an
affliction abated to which I have since been liable
at any moment of undue excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chastened within, however, as I had been, I
was not to escape chastisement without. For no
sooner had I begun, in some small measure, to
assimilate the food provided for me than I
became the victim of an unfortunate skin complaint
known, as I am informed, as erythema.
This was happily local, but it gave rise to a very
profound irritation, and one that proved, as my
father has often assured me, to be of a peculiarly
obstinate character. Naturally diffident, owing
to the site of the affection, to mention it even to
the family doctor, my parents exhausted their
every resource without procuring the least
alleviation. Though for night after night they
made it a matter of prayer, my sufferings were
pitiful, I have been told, to the last extreme;
and almost hourly, from supper-time to breakfast,
the darkness was rent with my cries.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unable at last, owing to his acute sensibilities,
to witness my agony any longer, my father was
obliged, with the deepest reluctance, to confine
himself to a separate bedroom. But it was in
this extremity that his almost Quixotic unselfishness
shone if possible with an added lustre.
From the time of his marriage to the day of my
birth, and as soon thereafter as the doctor had
permitted her to rise, my father had been in the
habit of enabling my mother to provide him with
an early cup of tea. And this he had done by
waking her regularly a few minutes before six
o’clock. In view of the fact, however, that he
was now occupying a different bedroom, and
that, owing to my indisposition, she was awake
most of the night, he offered to excuse her
should she chance to be asleep at that hour,
from the performance of this wifely duty.
Needless to say, it was not an offer that she
could accept. Indeed, in his heart he had not
expected her to do so. And I have even considered
the incident, in later days, as illustrative
of a certain weakness in my father’s character.
But I have never been able to regard it without
affection or to forbear mentioning it on appropriate
occasions.</p>

<p class='c014'>That in most respects, however, my father’s
temperament was an exceptionally unflinching
one was amply corroborated by the circumstances
attendant upon the choice of my second
godfather. This gave rise, as my father has
frequently told me, to the most prolonged and
anxious discussions, and entailed an enormous
amount of correspondence, some of which has
been preserved among the family documents.
For with his ruthless determination, inherited
by myself, to discover and expose every kind of
wrong-doing, with his life-long habit of informing
those in authority of any dereliction of duty
in themselves and their subordinates, and with
the passion for truth that compelled him on
every occasion instantly to correct what he
deemed the reverse, my father had necessarily
but little leisure to cultivate the easy art of
friendship. Amongst his acquaintances, indeed,
there were but few that even remotely
approximated to his standards; and he had
found none that his conscience had permitted
him to select for the purposes of personal
friendship.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was for this reason that, on the occasion of
his marriage, he had dispensed with the services
of a best man. And although the vicar had
eventually agreed to act as one of my male
sponsors, the appointment of a second began
to assume the proportions of an almost insoluble
problem. It being manifestly impossible to
hope for a suitable candidate among such persons
as occasionally called at the house, and my
father’s character having long ago isolated him
from his more immediate masculine relatives,
he resolved at last to appeal to the public sense
of the higher officials of the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was the result ungratifying, as various
letters still in my possession go to prove. Though
unable, owing to so many similar and previously
acquired obligations, to accede to my
father’s suggestion, all of them replied with the
greatest courtesy. Thus the Dean of St. Paul’s
wrote in person wishing me every success in
life; the Bishop of London trusted that my
father’s aspirations as to my personal holiness
would be realized; while the Archbishop of
Canterbury commanded his secretary to express
his gratification at the suggestion of an honour
that only the exigencies of his position as Primate
forbade him to accept. Needless to say, those
in charge of the State, whom my father next
approached, behaved very differently. Neither
the Prime Minister nor the Home Secretary saw
fit to reply at all, while the President of the
Board of Trade merely expressed a formal regret.
And yet in the end, as is so often the case, the
solution proved quite a simple one. Turn but a
stone, says a poet, and start a wing. And my
father did not even need to turn a stone. Sick
at heart, he was returning home one night when
he suddenly caught sight of himself in a cheesemonger’s
window. It was as though Providence,
he said, had touched him on the shoulder.
Whereas he had been blind, he said, then he
saw. For a moment the shock was almost too
much for him. A member of the constabulary,
indeed, actually asked him to move on. But
the solution was there, staring him in the face.
Involuntarily he raised his hat. <i>He himself was
the man.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>With my aunt, Mrs. Emily Smith, only too
eager to be my godmother, everything now
seemed to be propitious for the happy consummation
of my baptism, and no more earnest or
reverent gathering could have been found that
day in any metropolitan church. The vicar
being godfather, the actual ceremony was, at
my father’s suggestion, performed by the senior
curate, the junior curate, in deference to my
father’s position as sidesman, being on the
vicar’s right hand between him and my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the senior curate’s left stood my father,
flanked on his own left by the verger, the circle
round the font being completed by Mrs. Emily
Smith, my mother’s mother, my mother’s
father, her eight sisters and the aunt that had
stood with my mother’s mother at the foot of
the stairs. A soft April rain was refreshing the
outside world, and the first part of the service
had been successfully performed, when an
incident occurred that might well have been
attended with the most tragic and irreparable
consequences. For there suddenly took place,
just as I had been handed to the senior curate,
so acute an exacerbation of the erythema that,
in the ensuing convulsion, he was quite unable
to retain me in his grasp.</p>

<p class='c014'>I say unable, but, as my father pointed out to
him immediately after the close of the service,
had I suffered any provable damage he would
certainly have taken legal advice. Falling from
his arms, however, I remained poised for a
moment upon the extreme brim of the font, and
then fell forward, colliding with the vicar, who
stumbled backwards in his efforts to save me.
From the tottering vicar I then ricochetted, in
what I believe is a military phrase, towards the
feet of the junior curate, who became unexpectedly
the instrument of Providence. I do
not myself practise, nor do I greatly approve,
any form of merely athletic exercise. But it was
perhaps fortunate that the curate in question
happened to be a skilful player of cricket. For
just as my head was within an inch of the floor
and the blood had receded from every countenance,
he shot out his hand and succeeded in
catching me in a position technically known, I
believe, as the slips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, well held, sir!” cried the senior curate,
and then for a moment or two his emotion
overcame him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The vicar, still pale, recovered his balance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor little Augustus,” said my mother;
“it’s the irritation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father frowned at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Without prejudice,” he said. And then for
perhaps half a minute there was a deathly
silence. It was fractured, I have been told, by
myself, as the junior curate handed me back to
the senior.</p>

<p class='c014'>But my father intervened.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not again,” he said. “Never again; never
in this world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The silence was resumed, broken only by
myself. My father stood holding me, trembling
with emotion. The vicar took a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is the service to proceed?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly,” said my father. “But in other
hands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was another instance of his dominating
character, but also of his innate sense of justice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not insensible,” he said to the senior
curate, “of the services that you have already
rendered. But in the interests of my son, as
you must surely agree, I cannot again trust him
to your care.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The senior curate bowed, but did not articulate
a reply, and my father then handed me once
more to the junior. For a moment the latter
hesitated, but at the vicar’s request accepted
the privilege of concluding my baptism. Later,
I have been told, there was a certain amount of
argument, in which my father more than held
his own, finally absolving the vicar from further
sponsorial duties and notifying his decision to
transfer his worship elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a man of my father’s position this was a
serious step. But it was one that he did not
hesitate to take. And within a year, as I have
always been proud to remember, he had made
himself a sidesman at St. James-the-Lesser-Still,
Peckham Rye.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Apart</span> from the ill-health to which I have
previously made reference, but which was punctuated
with intervals of comparative well-being,
I have always regarded my first five or
six years as a particularly fruitful period. At
my father’s desire, almost in this case a command,
my mother began to study various books
on childhood, such as Dr. Brewinson’s <i>Childish
Complaints</i>, Mrs. Edward Podmere’s <i>Diet in
Infancy</i>, the Reverend Ambrose Walker’s <i>First
Steps in Religion</i>, Wilbur P. Nathan’s <i>The Babe
and the Infinite</i>, Mrs. Wood-Mortimer’s <i>Clothes
and the Young</i>, and Jonathan and Cornwall’s
<i>Dictionary of Home Medicine</i>. Each of these,
with the exception of the <i>Dictionary</i>, was
borrowed in turn from the nearest public library,
and it became my mother’s custom to consecrate
her afternoon rest hour to the perusal of these
volumes.</p>

<p class='c014'>According to an arrangement suggested by my
father, she would study one chapter each afternoon,
or alternatively three and a half pages
of the <i>Dictionary of Home Medicine</i>. On his
return from work, and after she had washed up
the supper dishes—for my father at this time
did not employ a domestic—he would put her
through a searching examination upon what
she had read earlier in the day. If, as was
frequently the case, since my mother was not
naturally scholastic, she failed to satisfy her
examiner, he would playfully impose upon her
the little penalty of again going through her
task before she went to bed. And on such
occasions, if he had not fallen asleep, he would
re-examine her when she came to bid him good-night.
If, on the other hand, her replies had
been judged adequate, it was an understood
thing that she might claim an extra kiss. So
seriously, indeed, did my mother apply herself
that she began to grow unattractively thin; and
once, when she had failed in her examination on
three successive nights, she actually burst into
tears. For this feminine weakness, when she
had asked his pardon, my father of course
readily forgave her, merely pointing out that,
with my future at stake, he was obviously unable
to relax his standards.</p>

<p class='c014'>Regarding me thus, from the very first, as a
sacred trust committed to their charge, this is
but a small example of the immense and unremitting
care with which my parents undertook
me. But it will at least suffice to show that
they had not underrated the high task to which
they had been called. To my father especially,
as the months slipped all too quickly by, I
became inexpressibly dear; and it was for that
reason among others that I escaped the torments
of vaccination. Though Jonathan and Cornwall’s
<i>Dictionary of Home Medicine</i> advocated
this operation on historical grounds, my father
had an instinctive, but none the less well-reasoned,
horror of the knife. Himself the
subject of frequent boils, he would never permit
these to be lanced, invariably giving orders that
they should be poulticed until Nature herself
brought about their evacuation. Nor can I say
that, in my own case, he has been other than
completely justified. It is true that I have
suffered, and still do suffer, apart from the
indigestion previously referred to, from several
forms of neurasthenia, a marked tendency to
eczema, occipital headaches, sour eructations,
and flatulent distension of the abdomen. But
from smallpox, although entirely unvaccinated,
I have always remained singularly immune.</p>

<p class='c014'>A similar prescience, too, sufficed to protect
me from the anguish and indignity of personal
chastisement. For although in principle my
father was an ardent supporter of this, and
indeed had administered it to several of his
relatives’ children, he had never required it,
he said, in his own case, and did not propose
to have it inflicted on me. And it was the
abrogation of this rule, although not until my
seventh year, by the son of a powerful Hibernian
charwoman that first revealed to me, in a never-to-be-forgotten
flash, some of the profoundest
depths of human iniquity.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was soon after my sixth birthday that my
father was first compelled to employ a charwoman,
owing to an attack of unconsciousness
on the part of my mother. For several months
she had been complaining of breathlessness,
incident upon certain of her domestic duties,
such as floor-scrubbing, home laundry-work,
cleaning the front steps, and polishing the boots
and shoes. With his usual consideration my
father had instantly remitted various other tasks
proper to her position, such as the baking of
bread twice a week, and the knitting of the
family socks and stockings; and he had further
excused her from my own daily tuition in both
Latin and arithmetic. Involving, as these subjects
did, considerable previous preparation, this
was of course a sensible relief, obtained though
it was at some hazard to my own intellectual
future. But despite all these concessions, she
continued to be unwell, and finally, as I have
said, lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a brief period, therefore, and after medical
advice, my father resolved to employ extraneous
aid, and at a very considerable financial sacrifice
engaged a person called Mrs. O’Flaherty. The
widow of a colour-sergeant, and one of the
church scrubbers, she was highly recommended
by the vicar of St. James-the-Lesser-Still, and
was not devoid, in certain deceptive respects,
of the superficial charm of her race. Ominously
developed as she was, both below and above the
waist, her features were informed with an unintelligent
but specious cheerfulness; and these,
together with a not unattractive complexion,
sufficed for some time to impose upon my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father, from the beginning, had his doubts
of her character, but in view of the vicar’s
recommendation, decided to employ her; and for
the first month or two, apart from her habit of
singing, found no cause for particular complaint.
He even went so far, upon my mother’s intercession,
as to allow the woman to bring her
youngest child with her, a somewhat gross and
over-exuberant lad a few months younger than
myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>That this youth, practically a gutter-snipe,
and afterwards a private in the army, should
have become a Brigadier-General in the late war,
and even have received, as I understand, some
kind of decoration, was one of the most deplorable
of the many social upheavals for which
that disaster was responsible.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the very outset, with that sensitiveness
of vision granted by Providence to certain
children, I regarded this new intruder with the
deepest suspicion. Obviously inheriting the
physique of his mother, and as it seemed the
proclivities of his father, his chief article of
amusement appeared to be a small cannon,
equipped with a spring for purposes of propulsion.
This he offered to lend me on the occasion
of his first visit, but declining his advances
I moved to another room, where I continued
my study of a book upon the apostles, written
for the young by a Somersetshire clergyman.</p>

<p class='c014'>Undeterred, however, by a reticence that
should have been more than sufficient for a boy
with the least good feeling, Desmond, for that
was his pretentious name, made a similar offer
on his second visit. Again I declined and
removed myself, subsequently mentioning the
matter to my father, who instantly gave orders
that for the future Mrs. O’Flaherty’s boy was
to be confined to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will kindly make it clear,” he said, “to
your son that I cannot have my own son disturbed,
and that admission to my house does
not necessarily include admission to my social
circle.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately, owing to a very natural slip
due to the rapidity of his elocution, my father
pronounced these words as sershle soakle; and
I have never forgotten the vulgar and ill-concealed
grin with which Mrs. O’Flaherty
promised to attend to the matter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the following Saturday, however, a
beautiful day in June, with the gerania in the
front garden in full bloom, Desmond O’Flaherty
again began to make overtures to me through
the open door of the kitchen. The parlour door
being again ajar, I was of course visible to him as
I reclined on the sofa; and I instantly observed
that he had brought his cannon with him and
that its muzzle was pointing towards myself.
Informing me that his pocket was full of peas,
suitably dried for the purposes of ammunition,
he then invited me to become his companion in
a game of definitely military character.</p>

<p class='c014'>This I refused, and I can still recall every
detail of all that followed. Happily employed
combing a grey rabbit, to which I was deeply
attached, and which I had named, but a day
or two previously, after the major prophet
Isaiah, I heard a faint click and the next moment
was violently struck upon the back of my
hand. Unable to suppress a cry of pain, I
involuntarily tightened my grip on Isaiah, who
suddenly turned his head and made a movement
as if about to bite my index finger. Realizing
as I did, from my knowledge of the
<i>Dictionary of Home Medicine</i>, the fatal consequences
that might possibly have ensued, I
flung him from me and sprang to the floor, almost
beside myself with fear and anguish. With an
expression of reproach that cut me to the very
heart Isaiah then retreated behind the harmonium;
and at the same moment I heard a
raucous laugh proceeding from the direction of
Desmond.</p>

<p class='c014'>But for Desmond and his mother I was alone
in the house, yet I did not hesitate to advance
towards the kitchen and grind the cannon
beneath my foot. Twice I stamped upon it
in what still seems to me a wholly righteous
indignation, and in a couple of seconds I had
reduced it to an irreparable wreck. For a
moment Desmond said nothing. I had taken
him by surprise. But then he rushed towards
me with a kind of snort, and fiercely hit me
on a face already suffused with tears. I turned
away from him shaken with sobs. But his
bestial appetites were still unsated. A second
and a third time he hit me, on both occasions
on the neck, and followed this up by an assault
with his foot upon the lower portion of my back.
But my cries, now almost amounting to shrieks,
had by this time attracted Mrs. O’Flaherty, and
at the same instant my father, returning early,
unlocked the front door. In a flash I was in
his arms and had sobbed out to him the whole
pitiful tale. I felt him quiver and then control
himself, as he gently placed me to one side.
Then he advanced to Desmond, pointing to the
crumpled cannon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pick that up,” he said, “and leave this house
for ever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Desmond replied insolently that he would not
do so, whereupon my father struck him smartly
upon the cheek. For a moment Desmond glared
at him, and then, lowering his head, he rushed
at my father, beating him with both fists.
Taken unawares, my father was obliged to sit
heavily down upon an entirely unpadded hall
chair, and once again I observed a malignant
smile upon the face of Mrs. O’Flaherty. But it
was only momentary. For, thrusting the little
savage away from him, my father hit him twice
with the handle of his walking-stick.</p>

<p class='c014'>As well aimed as they were richly deserved,
these blows took instant effect, the first knocking
the evil lad sideways, and the second dividing
the integument of his forehead. Suffering
though he was, my father then rose to his feet
and was once more about to address Desmond,
when Mrs. O’Flaherty, revealed in her true
character, ferociously caught him by the
shoulders. As I have already recorded, she was
a woman of repulsively over-developed physique,
and she now began to shake my father so violently
that his upper denture fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You little whelp!” she cried with incredible
blasphemy, “you little whelp of a bullying
puff-ball!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then to my horror, no less than to his own,
she lifted him bodily from the ground. For a
brief moment, or so it seemed to me, I was on
the verge of a merciful oblivion, but the next
instant I beheld Mrs. O’Flaherty thrusting my
father’s head into her pail. It was a commodious
pail, very nearly full with incompletely clean
water, and containing in addition the saturated
garment with which it was her habit to wash the
linoleum. Three separate times she immersed
his head in this, even submerging the backs of
his ears, and when at last she released him, and
he had regained his breath, he was more moved
than I had ever seen him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Always eloquent, his denunciation of her
conduct, deservedly attuned to the level of her
understanding, was of a severity that has
scarcely been equalled even in the writings of
my rabbit’s namesake. Time after time, with a
holy passion that repeatedly interfered with his
respiration, he felt it obligatory to adjure his
Creator to consign such a soul to its just perdition.
And when Mrs. O’Flaherty handed him
his upper denture he dashed it once more to the
ground. Finally he commanded her to leave
the house instantly, frankly informing her that
he should prosecute her for assault.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it’ll look real nice,” she said, “in the
local papers, chippin’ a child’s ’ead open and
’avin’ yer own in a pail.”</p>

<p><i>My dear Father in his prime taken from a group of sidesman of St. James-the-Less</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The malevolence with which she said this was
almost inconceivable. But, as my father pointed
out to me when she had gone, it raised issues of
the profoundest importance that would demand
his most serious consideration. For while in
his own person—<i>in propria persona</i><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>—it might
be his duty to bring her before the magistrates,
it might be no less important, as a sidesman
of the Established Church, to avoid the contingent
publicity. This indeed was the decision
to which he ultimately came, and as an instance
of what may be called, perhaps, his sanctified
statesmanship, it has always seemed to me to
shed a peculiar radiance upon one of the
sublimest aspects of his character. With regard,
however, to the lethargy, little less than criminal,
of the vicar of St. James-the-Lesser-Still, I have
always been at a loss; and I cannot help suspecting,
as indeed my father openly suggested
to him, that his relations with Mrs. O’Flaherty
were not at all what they should have been.
For not only did he deprecate, having heard my
father’s narrative, what he weakly described
as any precipitate action, but she was actually
observed by an acquaintance of my father’s
scrubbing the church floor upon the following
evening.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f1'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In his own person.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Under such circumstances my father had no
choice but to hasten instantly to the vicarage,
where he confronted the vicar with the suggestion—an
extremely natural one—already
referred to. But his reply, as my father has
often assured me, was neither Xtian nor
even gentlemanly, and my father was obliged
therefore, with the deepest reluctance, once
more to transfer his worship. It was a serious
step, but he had been fortified with the experience
previously forced upon him at St. James-the-Less,
and in less than five months he had
become one of the foremost sidesmen at St.
James-the-Least-of-All, Kennington Oval.</p>

<p class='c012'>Further years of boyhood and additional crosses. Progress
in study and music. I excel at the game of Nuts in May.
I am to go to Hopkinson House School. But Providence
again intervenes. I become a victim of the ring-worm.
Devastating effect of an ointment. Mr. Balfour Whey
and his sons. A brutal County Court judge. But my
father obtains damages.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Physically</span> shattered as I had been by the
attack on my person by Desmond O’Flaherty,
the mental and spiritual consequences of this
assault were far more serious and prolonged.
Awakened for the first time to the contemporary
existence of a depravity hitherto unsuspected
by me, I was unable for several weeks to regain
my previous composure, or indeed to venture
unaccompanied beyond the precincts of the
house. Nor could I bear even to contemplate
the introduction of a successor to Mrs.
O’Flaherty.</p>

<p class='c014'>For that reason, although still in poor health,
my mother was obliged to resume her former
duties, while my father was confirmed in his
decision to postpone my schooldays for another
three or four years. To this he had already
been inclined, partly owing to the representations
that I myself had been compelled to make to
him, and partly owing to his desire to assist me
as far as possible in bearing the crosses with
which Providence had entrusted me. Far
beyond the average both in weight and number,
I can realize now of course what a privilege
these were. But in the earlier years of my
boyhood they taxed my faith to its utmost
powers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many were the times, for instance, when after
a long morning’s study, merely interrupted by
an occasional cup of cocoa, I turned with avidity
to a simple but abundant meal of roast pork and
open jam tart, only to find myself, an hour or
two later, rolling in agony upon the sofa, or
even indeed summoned on certain occasions to
yield it back whence it came. This was perhaps
the hardest lesson of all. But I am happy to
say that at last I learned it. And I can well
remember the pride with which my father,
hurrying into the parlour with a convenient
receptacle, first found me consoling myself
with some appropriate verses from an early
chapter of the book of Job.</p>

<p class='c014'>That incident alone, as my father often used
to say, was a complete justification of his
decision to postpone my school-life; and I am
quite confident that, had I been earlier subjected
to the propinquity of coarser-fibred boys, I
should never have survived to render adult
service to the men and women of my time.
Nor should I have made, I am sure, such
intellectual progress as I achieved between my
sixth and eleventh birthdays. Familiar from
cover to cover not only with the Holy Bible, but
also with the Apocrypha, I had attained dexterity
in simple division, was acquainted with the
geography of the British Isles, and had read
the history of England so far as the reign of
Queen Anne. Passionately devoted to music, I
had taught myself to play from memory the
airs of a large number of well-known hymns,
including several of the more rapid and accentuated
of the late Messrs. Moody and Sankey.
Subject to my father’s guidance, too, I ranged
in boyish fashion amongst literature of a lighter
order. With some of the works of Longfellow,
for instance, I was soon so familiar as to be
able to repeat them without a mistake, and I can
still recall the delight with which I read a work
of fiction in which Martin Luther was one of
the characters portrayed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Happy as I was, however, with some such
volume as this, a pound or two of chocolates,
and my rabbit Isaiah, or to settle down for a
long summer afternoon with the Hymnal Companion
to the Book of Common Prayer, I was
not averse from an occasional ramble in the
company of my father, or even from exercise of a
more vehement order with younger and suitable
comrades. The chief of these latter was Emily
Smith, the granddaughter of Mrs. Emily Smith,
my mother’s aunt, a gentle child, who was
unfortunately an albino, but of a deeply religious
and sympathetic nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>A year or two older than myself, she lived
with her grandmother at New Cross, and in
her company and that of some of her school
companions, I played several health-giving
and mirthful games. One of our favourites, I
remember, was Hide and Go Seek, combining
both physical and mental exertion; and another,
of which we were hardly less fond, was known as
Nuts in May.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the purposes of this latter game those
who proposed to take part would first form
themselves into two equal groups, the members
of each moiety then standing side by side,
facing the same way and holding each other’s
hands. The two groups would then take up
positions, each opposite each, in joyous anticipation,
and so arranged as to secure a space between
them sufficient for an alternating advance and
retreat. By a previous arrangement one of the
two sides would then approximate itself to the
other, singing in unison and to an established
melody, the following humorously incongruous
lines.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here we go gathering nuts in May, nuts in May, nuts in May,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here we go gathering nuts in May</div>
      <div class='line'>On a cold and frosty morning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>That we were not in fact doing so was of course
obvious. But the innocent laughter that the
words always provoked in us was quite sufficient,
in the opinion of myself and my comrades, to
rob them of any semblance of deliberate
untruthfulness.</p>
<p class='c014'>It would then become the turn of the previously
silent and stationary players to advance singing
a second stanza, in which they would merrily
inquire which of their number was to be chosen
as symbolic of these nuts in May. To them in
reply the first group would designate a member
of the second, whereupon the second group
would once more advance with the very pertinent
query:—</p>
<p class='c020'><i>Whom will you send to fetch her</i> (or <i>him</i>, if it was
myself) <i>away, fetch her</i> (or <i>him</i>, if it was myself)
<i>away, fetch her</i> (or <i>him</i>, if it was myself) <i>away</i>,</p>
<p class='c021'><i>Whom will you send to fetch her</i> (or <i>him</i>, if it was myself) <i>away</i>,</p>
<p class='c021'><i>On a cold and frosty morning</i>?</p>
<p class='c013'>The members of the first group would then
select one of their comrades to be the emissary
of conveyance, and to the same melody and with
a similar gesture, would announce their choice
to the second group. A pocket-handkerchief,
folded upon itself diagonally, would then be
stretched upon the grass, parallel to and midway
between the merry and expectant companies
of players. The symbolized nut and its would-be
gatherer would then face each other across the
extended handkerchief, grasp hands, and each
earnestly endeavour to draw the other across
the separating fabric. To whomsoever was
successful the other would then be accorded as
a member henceforward of the victor’s group,
and the game would proceed as before with
ever-increasing mirth.</p>
<p class='c014'>Ultimately it might happen, and indeed it
often did, that one of the sides would finally
absorb the other, and the absorbing side
usually including myself, my services were
naturally in the keenest demand. I soon
found in fact that, in spite of my ill-health, I
was singularly adapted to this form of recreation.
Inheriting, as I did, to a very great extent, my
father’s powerful and sonorous voice, I was able
to throw myself with dominating effect into the
preliminary vocal exchanges, while my physique
stood me in admirable stead in the later stages
of the game. For though I was short, with
singularly slender arms, my abdomen was large
and well covered, while my feet, with their
exceptional length and breadth and almost
imperceptible arches, enabled me to obtain a
tenacious hold of the ground upon which they
were set.</p>

<p class='c014'>So proficient in fact did I become that when I
went to school I was bitterly disappointed to
find that this, my favourite game of play, was
not even included in the curriculum. In later
years I have heard this game criticized both on
moral and physical grounds, and even my friend
and vicar, the Reverend Simeon Whey, has had
grave doubts as to its permissibility. On many
occasions indeed we have sat far into the night
arguing about its effect on the Xtian character.
But I am happy to say that he has now gone so
far as to approve of it for others. Indeed, as
I have more than once facetiously suggested to
him, his real objections to the game have been
personal, founded on a lack of success in its
practice that may well have prejudiced his
outlook. For though he is no mean exponent
of the game of Draughts, as well as that of Word
Making and Word Taking, at Nuts in May he
has seldom if ever avoided being drawn across
the handkerchief. As the result of my protests,
however, he has continued to permit the game
to be one of the brightest features of our annual
Sunday School gatherings; and most of our
schoolmistresses, I think, would be compelled to
testify that I have retained all my old-time
skill.</p>

<p class='c014'>In such fashion, then, I emerged into my
twelfth year; and, albeit with considerable
misgivings, my father arranged at last for my
entry into a high-class school in the neighbourhood.
Known as Hopkinson House School for
the Sons of Gentlemen, it was conveniently
situated in Jasmine Grove on the southern
outskirts of Camberwell, and included features
in its dignified exterior of almost every type
of architecture. Approached by a semi-circular
gravel drive with gates of entry and exit, it
was flanked on both sides, and isolated in the
rear, by an asphalt recreation-ground. Above
the front steps, two chocolate-coloured pillars
supported a classical portico, and the windows
of the first-floor rooms were surmounted with
characteristic Gothic mouldings. The windows
of the first, second and third storeys were of a
simpler Georgian pattern, but the roof was
uplifted, at its anterior corners, into castellated
Norman turrets. Midway between these, an
Elizabethan gable formed a pleasing contrast,
and the two chimney-stacks, each bearing a
lightning-conductor, were decorated with Moorish
relief work.</p>

<p class='c014'>Conducted by a Mr. Septimus Lorton, the
successor to Mr. Hopkinson, the founder of the
school, it was daily attended by some seventy
or eighty of the sons of the Peckham and
Camberwell gentry. Concerning Mr. Lorton
I shall have more to say presently, but just about
a week before what was to have been my first
term, a tender but inscrutable Providence once
again intervened. The agent of this new affliction
was a parasite commonly known, I understand,
as the ring-worm, and within a brief
period it had established upon my head no less
than four separate colonies. That being the
case, not only was my school-life yet a second
time postponed, but I was obliged to render up,
under medical orders, and that the extent of
the malady might be the more easily discernible,
the greater proportion of my abundant and not
unattractive chestnut hair. To the first of these
consequences I was reconciled with no great
difficulty, but to the second, I must confess,
resignation was not so easy; and for night after
night my pillow was moistened with tears
scarcely restrained during the day. But worse
was to follow. For upon the appearance of a
fifth and even more intractable settlement, the
doctor in charge of the case took the opportunity
of prescribing a wholly unjustifiable ointment.
That it slew the parasites was undoubtedly true.
But such were the ravages of this violent medicament
that, to an accompaniment of the acutest
distress, the whole of my hair disappeared.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even in this, however, probably up till then
the darkest hour of my existence, Providence
had set a rainbow across my despair from which
I have never since failed to glean comfort.
Roused to the very depths of his indignant
paternity, my father immediately began to take
steps against the doctor, while both Mrs. Emily
Smith, the grandmother of my little comrade,
and the aunt that had stood with my mother’s
mother at the bottom of the stairs, provided
me with velveteen skull-caps, skilfully embroidered
with forget-me-nots.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps the most fruitful, however, of the
issues of this affliction, apart from the damages
that my father ultimately secured, was the life-long
friendship that it produced between ourselves
and the Whey family. A junior sidesman
to my father at St. James-the-Least-of-All, Mr.
Balfour Whey was not only a rising solicitor,
but the father of two boys, Simeon and Silas.
To the elder of these, Simeon, I have already
referred as the vicar of the parish in which I at
present reside. But Silas, since dead under
distressing circumstances, to which I shall refer
in due course, was but half an hour younger,
and they were usually regarded as being twins.</p>

<p class='c014'>Xtian lads of about my own age, and each
with an impediment in his speech, both were
destined on this account for eventual ordination
in the Church of England. What knitted us
together, however, at this painful juncture was
the curious fact that, in addition to others,
both of them were suffering like myself from an
invasion of the ring-worm. Adequately treated,
however, they had retained their hair, and, as
their father immediately perceived, might for
this reason prove invaluable witnesses in the
prosecution upon which we had determined.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>From a portrait of the Aunt who stood and my mother’s mother at the foot of the stairs</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In this Mr. Balfour Whey had already consented
to act as my father’s legal adviser, on the
understanding that, if the case should fail, my
father should be exempt from the payment of
charges, while, if it should succeed, the
damages should be shared between them on
agreed and equitable terms. An extremely
forcible Hibernian barrister was then engaged
on a similar basis, and never shall I forget the
noble determination of these two earnest and
devoted men. Fortified with the assistance,
somewhat expensive, but under the circumstances
deemed necessary, of an extremely adaptable,
intelligent, and experienced medical expert,
they proved far too powerful both for the
doctor, a young man unrepresented by counsel,
and even for the County Court judge, a sinister-looking
person evidently addicted to alcohol.
Nevertheless it was no easy fight and the bias
of the judge was obvious from the outset. Time
after time when my father rose from his seat
in the well of the court to make ejaculations, he
commanded him to be silent in a tone of voice
that no gentleman should have used to another.
And once when my mother’s aunt, Mrs. Emily
Smith, and the aunt that had stood with my
mother’s mother at the foot of the stairs, rose
simultaneously and cried, “Oh, you story,”
after an unveracious comment by the doctor,
he actually threatened to have them ejected by
one of his underlings in the court.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was he more polite to my mother’s eight
sisters, industrious young women who had
brought their knitting, even going so far as to
say that, if they continued to rattle their needles,
he should have them similarly transported.
To this my father very naturally objected in
one of his most dignified and impassioned
speeches, again cut short, though not without
the utmost difficulty, by this self-assertive and
presumptuous man. Even to Simeon and Silas
Whey, each of whom had covered the Bible with
kisses, he behaved in such a fashion as entirely
to rob them of their natural joy in being in the
witness-box. For though it was true, and only
to be expected, that their vocal disabilities were
increased by their excitement, he not only
professed to consider them irrelevant but
brutally informed them that they were unintelligible.
For a moment we were stunned. But
then, as one woman, my mother’s eight sisters
rose to their feet, as did Mrs. Balfour Whey,
Mrs. Emily Smith, and the aunt that had stood
with my mother’s mother at the foot of the
stairs. Led by my father they shouted “Shame”
in tones that shook the very roof, while the
Hibernian barrister, with a gesture that I have
never seen equalled, swept his papers from the
desk before him, and sank speechless into his
seat.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was such a scene as no one in the court
had probably ever before witnessed, and even
the judge seemed slightly taken aback by the
volume of resentment that he had aroused. It
was at any rate with a distinct tremor and in
markedly altered tones that he ordered the
proceedings to be resumed. And when I myself,
as the prosecution’s last witness, proceeded to
take the oath in my velveteen skull-cap, his
change of colour was so manifest as to become
the subject of general comment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Keeping my face firmly towards him, upon
the advice of my counsel, I stood unshaken,
albeit not unmoved, during the latter’s preliminary
remarks. Here was a lad, he said, in the
soft and vibrant tones of the convinced and
accomplished pleader, the only lad, nay, the
only child, the solitary hope of his devoted
parents. Too delicate hitherto to have been
sent to the school—the scholastic establishment
for which his abilities had long since qualified
him, he had been happily expecting, with all
the ardour that His Honour would observe
imprinted on his countenance, to have entered
this academy of learning some seven weeks
before. But what had happened? His Honour
had heard. It was the subject matter of this
action. Not only had his career, since time was
money, been already seriously crippled, but he
had been subjected to a personal mutilation,
the moral effect of which it was impossible to
appraise. One moment a happy—nay, he might
almost say without unduly straining the truth—one
moment a happy, but not only a happy, a
positively handsome young gentleman, he had
been reduced in the next, either by wilful
design, by malevolent neglect, or by an infamous
want of knowledge, to the spectacle that he
would be obliged—how reluctantly His Honour
could imagine—to submit to His Honour’s
inspection.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here a low ripple of sympathy and horror
broke involuntarily from most of those present;
and it was perhaps significant, as Mr. Whey
remarked to my father, that the judge took no
steps to suppress it. Then, after a brief question
or two, since, as my counsel said, mine was an
ordeal that he dared not long prolong, he asked
me to remove my velveteen skull-cap and let
His Honour see what was underneath. It was
an effort. But I achieved it, and the effect
on the judge was instantaneous. In spite of
his pallor, he had still, up to that point, retained
some evidences of his gross habit of life. But
now the last vestige of his colour had left him,
and he seemed visibly to have lost weight.
Contracted to pin-points, his pupils were fixed
upon my scalp in a haggard yet fascinating
stare; and great beads of perspiration began
to glisten upon his forehead. Then, with a
sharp expiration like that of a punctured bicycle
tyre, he covered his eyes for a moment with his
hand, and I knew instinctively, as I replaced my
skull-cap, that the case was won.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were further arguments, of course,
and technical exchanges, but to everyone in
court they must have seemed of little moment;
and I was soon being embraced by father, my
aunts and great-aunts, in the happy consciousness
that right had triumphed. Nor was that
all. For thanks to the damages awarded, my
father and myself were enabled to spend a
month at Scarborough, while a generous fee
was paid by a well-known firm of hair-restorers
for a copy of a photograph of my head that
my father had thoughtfully taken. Two years
later they paid a similar sum for a photograph
of the same area normally covered, both being
subsequently reproduced, under another name
of course, and with the interval diminished for
commercial purposes, as illustrative of the effects
of what has since become, I believe, a very
profitable commodity.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c009'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>First experience at Hopkinson House School. It is amongst
the masters that I hope to find spiritual companionship.
I do not do so. Apology of Mr. Muglington. I am struck
by a football. Subsequent apology of Mr. Beerthorpe.
Degraded habits of my fellow-scholars. A fearful
discovery and its sequel. Amazing ineptitude of Mr.
Lorton. Concerted assault upon my person. I am
rescued by my father, who procures a public apology.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Owing</span> to the successive delays imposed by my
general ill-health, the assault upon my person
by Desmond O’Flaherty, the sudden invasion
of the ring-worm, and the cranial nudity wrought
by the ointment, it was not until I was nearly
fourteen that I was at last able to attend school;
and even then it was perhaps doubtful whether
my father should have recommended it. For,
although by that time my health was somewhat
less precarious, the chastening experiences that
I had been called upon to endure had naturally
lifted me, in almost every respect, far above
the plane of most of my contemporaries. And
while it was true, of course, that in Simeon and
Silas Whey I should find sympathetic and well-liked
comrades, I was so much older, both
mentally and spiritually, than such of their
acquaintances as I had chanced to meet that it
was only amongst the masters that there seemed
any reasonable hope of obtaining an equal and
appropriate companionship.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was to this end, therefore, while endeavouring
at the same time to place my services at the
disposal of my fellow-scholars, that I resolved
from the outset to encourage my tutors to perceive
in me a staunch and valuable associate.
For the first few days this was not of course
easy, owing to the natural confusion incident
upon a new term, and it was only by the interjection
of an occasional informative remark that
I was enabled to adumbrate my ultimate purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus when our form-master, a Mr. Muglington,
asked me if I knew the capital of Belgium, I
replied that while I had not as yet enjoyed the
opportunity of paying the town a personal visit,
I had been credibly informed that it was known
as Brussels, so indissolubly associated with the
well-known brassica.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Though he was a repellent-looking
man with a ginger moustache, I
had nevertheless accompanied the words with a
friendly smile. But he merely stared at me in
what I was compelled to recognise as a singularly
crude and offensive fashion.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f2'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The botanical family that includes the sprout. I am now
convinced that Mr. Muglington did not know this.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Let me see,” he said, “I think your name is
Carp.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Augustus Carp,” I replied, “of Angela
Gardens.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then kindly remember,” he said, “to confine
yourself in future to the information asked for
and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was of course the speech of a peculiarly
narrow-minded and vindictive man, fortuitously
thrust into a position of authority that had
evidently nourished his worst propensities. But
I had not as yet realized how deplorably typical
he was of the class to which he belonged, and it
was a considerable time before I could restrain
the sobs that his infamous words had provoked.
Nor did he fail to take a further and dastardly
advantage of my emotion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps,” he observed, with a malignant
sneer, “when you’ve quite finished chewing the
cud, you’d be so kind as to oblige us by enumerating
the principal exports of Finland.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Afterwards, I am glad to say, thanks to the
instant and imperative demand of my father,
he was obliged to apologise to me both in my
father’s presence and in that of the head
master, Mr. Septimus Lorton. But it was not
an apology, as I discerned at once, founded on any
real and heart-felt contrition, and although I
assured him that, so far as I was concerned,
he might consider the incident closed, it was
perfectly apparent to me that I could never in
the future admit him to the privileges of
friendship.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was I destined to receive a more satisfying
response from the next advance that it seemed
my duty to make. Excused on moral grounds
from the study of French by a special stipulation
of my father, I was permitted instead to take
extra lessons in German from a Mr. Beerthorpe.
A stoutly-built man with extremely short sight,
corrected by lenses of exceptional thickness, I
was at first attracted to this person by an
expression of what I soon discovered was a
spurious amiability. I was also distressed to
find him almost universally alluded to by the
first syllable of his name only, to which the
letter y, not originally present in it, had been
appended by way of suffix.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whether or not he was aware of this I did not
of course know, but both as an act of kindness
and in justice to myself, I felt it incumbent on
me to seek the earliest chance of dissociating
myself from such a practice. I accordingly
took the opportunity one day, when he was
acting as arbitrator in a game of football in the
playground, of approaching him and touching
him on the elbow and suggesting that I should
like to have a few words with him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Eh, what?” he said. “Foul,” and he then
blew a blast, I remember, on a small whistle.
Taken unawares, I could not refrain from
shuddering a little, and instinctively put my
hands to my ears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what is it?” he asked. “What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps we might withdraw,” I replied, “to
some quieter place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what’s the trouble?” he said. “Look
out,” and he abruptly leapt back to avoid the
oncoming football. Not so fortunate, and left
entirely unprotected by Mr. Beerthorpe’s sudden
retreat, I received the full impact of the hurtling
projectile upon the upper part of my neck and
my left ear, and for some moments I was entirely
unable to proceed with the conversation. Indeed
had the missile been of the egg-shaped variety
frequently employed, I understand, in the same
barbarous pursuit, the blow might well have
had the most serious, if not fatal, consequences.
Nor could I help feeling a trifle disheartened to
perceive, when I had regained my powers of
speech, that Mr. Beerthorpe was still callously
blowing his whistle in a remote corner of the
playground. Under such circumstances many
another lad would have been deflected from his
purpose. But in spite of what followed, I have
always been glad to remember that I did not
allow myself to be deterred. Approaching him
a second time, I again touched his elbow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good God,” he said, “are you still there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Naturally flinching a little at the expletive,
I reminded him that I had still something to
communicate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, all right,” he said. “Come along then.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He handed his instrument to a neighbouring
boy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered an empty schoolroom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps I may first,” I said, “ask you to
accept this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a box of chocolates weighing half a
pound and tastefully adorned with a lemon-coloured
ribbon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is merely a token,” I proceeded, “albeit
I hope an acceptable one, of a desire to inaugurate
friendly relations.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment he stared at it with his mouth
open and then made a rasping noise in the back
of his throat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But look here,” he said, “you don’t mean to
tell me that you’ve interrupted a game of football
just to bring me in here and give me half a
pound of chocolates?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not wholly,” I said, “nor even principally,
though I am naturally a little wounded by your
tone of voice. But I also desired to inform you
that you were the subject of a prevalent indignity
from which personally I have strongly dissented.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good God!” he said. “What on earth do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>After flinching a second time, I lowered my
voice a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought you ought to know,” I said,
“that you are very generally referred to—I
trust without foundation—as Beery.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For perhaps twelve, or it might have been
thirteen, seconds, the silence was only broken
by the cries of the footballers. But I observed
that his cheeks were suffused with blood and his
myopic eyes beginning to bulge. It was a
repulsive sight, and then, like Mr. Muglington,
he stood revealed in his true character. No less
intoxicated than the former with the petty
authority conferred by his position, his general
conduct, as well as his verbiage, was even
coarser and more debased.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look here,” he said, “young What’s-your-name,
I don’t know your name, and I don’t
want to. But if I have any more of your
insolence I shall report you to the headmaster.
And now you can clear out and take your
chocolates with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Stung to the quick, and with the tears running
down my cheeks, I nevertheless held up my
hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One moment,” I said. “You have misapprehended
me, and it was perhaps foolish of me to
have supposed that it could have been otherwise.
But I must clearly point out to you, both for
my own sake and that of the school to which we
both belong, that it will be rather I who shall
be obliged to report you for the language that I
have listened to this day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Florid to an extreme that I have seldom
seen equalled, he opened his mouth once or
twice in silence. Then he wiped his forehead
with the back of his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had rather flattered myself,” he said, “on
my temperance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On the contrary,” I said, “I am obliged to
remind you that you have twice openly invoked
the Deity.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good God!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c014'>I opened the door for him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That makes the third time,” I said. “You
will hear more of this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had preserved my self-control, but it was
only with an effort that left me pitiably weak
and wretched and induced a gastritis that robbed
me of several minutes’ sleep as well as of most
of my evening meal. Thanks, however, to a
second and even more trenchant interview
between my father and Mr. Lorton, during
which it transpired that Mr. Beerthorpe was the
father of five unfortunate children, he too was
obliged to apologise to me and give me an
undertaking to restrain his blasphemy. But, as
my father agreed, it was an apology obviously
given with the utmost reluctance and affording
no hope of the happier communion to which I
had at one time looked forward.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile I had not neglected my fellow-students,
unattractive to me as most of them
were, and more than once had I offered
my spiritual services to an inexperienced or
erring class-mate. That these had been fruitless
I am not prepared to say. But it was perhaps
not surprising, considering the standard of the
masters, that the general moral status of their
pupils should have left almost everything to be
desired. Such a rule, for example, as that
forbidding the ingestion of sweetmeats during
the hours set apart for study was daily infringed,
not only by the younger boys, but by many far
older than myself. Exhibitions, too, of personal
violence were only too common in the playground,
and I had even heard boys, presumably the sons
of gentlemen, making use of the word damn.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f3'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I repeat this with regret. But truth is often best served,
I have found, by being completely outspoken.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was not until nearly half-term, however,
under the eyes of Mr. Lorton, and in the most
sacred hour of the scholastic week, that I
suddenly became conscious of the existence of
an evil that for a moment completely paralysed
me. Himself an organiser rather than a scholar,
a proprietor rather than a professor, Mr. Lorton
confined himself, in respect of actual teaching,
to the exposition of the Holy Scriptures. For
this purpose he visited each class once a week
in rotation, the text-book employed being the
Lorton Bible for Schools, published by his
brother, Mr. Chrysostom Lorton. We had been
studying, I remember, the Second Book of Kings,
and considering the evil reign of Pekahiah, when
Mr. Lorton suddenly asked the head boy of the
form if he could tell him the name of his
successor.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was of course Pekah, the son of Remaliah,
with whom I had been familiar for several years.
But unfortunately my position in the centre of
the class forbade my giving an immediate answer.
Nevertheless I perceived, as boy after boy
mutely revealed the depths of his ignorance,
that I had probably been destined by the grace
of Providence to become the means of their
enlightenment. What was my horror, then, on
this beautiful autumn day, with the November
sunlight slanting through the window, to observe
Harold Harper, the boy on my left, and
Henry Hancock, the boy on my right, each
studying the Second Book of Kings under the
shelter conferred by his desk. Objectionable
lads as I knew them both to be, I had never
dreamed them to have been capable of this, and
when Henry Hancock rose in his place and
without a tremor said, “Pekah, son of Remaliah,”
it was as though each syllable had been a knife
deeply plunged into my very vitals. Pale with
wrath I rose to my feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sir,” I cried, “Henry Hancock was deceiving
you. He read his answer from the open
Scripture.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a deathly pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And not only that,” I said, “but Harold
Harper was prepared to do the same.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton removed his eye-glasses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hancock and Harper,” he said, “stand up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They did so, but with marked reluctance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hancock and Harper,” he said, “is this
true?”</p>

<p class='c014'>They were silent. But their faces betrayed
them, as did Harper’s Bible, that slipped to the
floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hancock and Harper,” said Mr. Lorton, “I
am ashamed of you. You must each write me
out fifty lines.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, sir,” I cried, “in justice to myself, who
knew the correct answer without committing
sacrilege, nay, in justice to my fellow-scholars,
to say nothing of Holy Writ, surely these lads
must be subjected to some less trivial and
severer penalty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton readjusted his glasses. Then he
removed them again and began to wipe them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hanper and Harcock,” he said, “I mean
Harcock and Hanper, as Carp has reminded you,
you have sinned very grievously. But I hope—er—this
publicity, this publicity, I say, will not
be lacking in its due effect upon you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, sir,” I cried, “these are mere words.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are very serious ones,” he said, “very
serious ones. Also, as I said, you will each write
me fifty lines. And now perhaps Smith Major
can tell us who Argob was.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Petrified by the levity with which the very
owner of the school was able to endure so
shattering an exposure, I remained standing for
several seconds, wholly unable to utter a syllable.
And when I sank at last, stunned and unsupported,
into the seat from which I had so lately
risen, it was as though my boyhood (and indeed
this was actually the case) had been finally
snatched from me for ever. Nor was this the
end. For, when we emerged into the playground,
I found myself surrounded by an opprobrious
mob, evidently suborned by Harper and Hancock
for the purposes of physical assault and battery.
Thrust from one to the other, my collar was
disarranged, I was several times smitten upon
the face, and it was only by the exercise of my
utmost lung-power that I succeeded in attracting
adult attention. Indeed I am almost certain
that I observed Mr. Muglington and Mr. Beerthorpe
lurking supine behind a curtain, and it
was by no less a person than my own father that
I was ultimately removed from danger.</p>

<p class='c014'>Collecting an account a couple of streets
away, he had instantly recognised my screams,
and, abandoning everything, had rushed to my
aid just as Mr. Lorton hurried into the playground.
But my father was first, and never shall
I forget the stentorian thunder of his tones.
Seizing in each hand one of my lesser persecutors,
he shook them like thistles before the
wind, while time after time, breaking into his
highest falsetto, he overtopped even my most
piercing note. Colourless and stricken, a little
group of masters stood huddled against the wall
of the house, while an ever-growing stream of
neighbours and local tradesmen began to throng
every inch of the asphalt. Then, with a final
and supreme imprecation, he flung the two
ruffians into the midst of their fellows, and clasping
me to his bosom, clove his way through the
now vociferously applauding multitude. It was
perhaps the greatest moment of his career, but
like myself he had to pay the penalty for it, and
for the following two weeks we were confined
in adjacent bedrooms, while my mother had
to wait upon us night and day. Afterwards,
shaken as he was, he had a third interview with
Mr. Lorton, insisting upon and obtaining a
public apology as the only alternative to legal
proceedings.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Reasons for remaining at Hopkinson House School. I pass
from boyhood to early young manhood. Expeditions
both urban and rural in the company of my dear father.
An excellent and little-known diversion. Youthful
adventures by sea and land. But what is to be my
career on leaving school? Various alternatives prayerfully
considered. A vision is vouchsafed to us by
Providence. A commercial Xtian. My first razor.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>I have</span> frequently been asked, and I have but
little doubt that hosts of my readers will put
the same query to me, why I did not, after such
an experience, transfer my attendance to another
school. And I ought to say at once, perhaps,
that both my father and myself were strongly
disposed to this course. Having regard to the
facts, however, that Hopkinson House School
was the only one in the neighbourhood for sons
of gentlemen; that my moral position had now
been defined there beyond any possibility of
doubt; that the apologies elicited would probably
secure me in the future from any further
corporal interference; and that both Simeon
and Silas Whey had expressed their horror at
my treatment—in view of these facts, we came
to the conclusion that, for the present at any
rate, I had better remain there. That it could
never be the same to me was of course the case.
But then my hopes had not been extravagant.
And although, as I have indicated, my boyhood
had been ruthlessly plucked from me like a
geranium in full bud, my early young manhood
found me securer than ever in the approval
of a wise and discerning Providence. Apart
from an occasional boil, too, and a somewhat
intractable and disfiguring affection known as
acne, my health was giving rise to less anxiety
than for some time past, and I have always
looked back on the next two years as amongst
the happiest of my life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Necessarily thrown, as the result of what had
happened, very largely upon my own resources,
I was agreeably surprised to find that these were
even richer and more varied than I had supposed;
and I frequently walked, on a Saturday
afternoon, as far as Dulwich or Blackheath,
thoroughly contented with the company of
none other than myself. What was my joy,
too, to discover, a couple of weeks after my
fifteenth birthday, that my voice had broken
into a full-toned bass that promised to be even
more powerful than my father’s; and many a
long hour did we spend at the harmonium
together in friendly competition over our
favourite hymns. Though he was rather more
accurate than myself in the matter of tune, in
the matter of time there was little to choose
between us, while in the actual volume of sound
produced I was soon my father’s equal, if not
his superior.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was singing our only mutual occupation,
for once a month, thanks to my father’s
generosity, we would journey to such a place of
instructional interest as the Tower of London
or Sir John Soane’s Museum. We even visited,
I remember, the National Gallery of Art,
with its remarkable collection of hand-painted
pictures; and I can still recall the delicacy with
which my father would intervene to shelter me
from any that contained an undraped female
figure.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps our happiest times, however, were
those spent with Nature during my father’s
annual fortnight’s holiday, when we would
usually procure lodgings at some such salubrious
resort as Clacton-on-Sea or Cliftonville near
Margate. Here we would abandon ourselves
to the contemplation of the waves, and here,
under my father’s skilful tuition, I became
quite an adept at an entrancing pursuit less
well known, I think, than it should be.</p>

<p class='c014'>Consisting in the first place of the selection of
a flat-shaped stone—itself often a gleeful and
difficult task—it then becomes the object of the
participators in the game to propel this seawards
across the surface of the ocean. Being
heavier than water, it would naturally be supposed
that at the first impact with the latter
the stone would sink; and indeed, if projected by
an unskilled player, this is what usually eventuates.
As I was happy to demonstrate, however,
to our Sunday School mistresses only last
year at Southend, in the hands of a careful and
experienced performer this is by no means
necessarily the case. Supporting the stone,
with its flatter surface downwards, on the flexed
middle finger of the thrower’s hand, his (or her)
forefinger should lie along its circumference, the
thumb gently resting on its superior surface. It
should then be so cast as to travel horizontally,
its flat surface parallel to the surface of the water,
with the surprising result that, when at last it
drops, it bounces into the air again and proceeds
onwards. Nay, it may even, in the hands
of the most expert, repeat this process two or
three times, to the intense and delighted
fascination of those who have been privileged
to witness him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not lacking in the element of competition,
yet devoid of all possibility of personal danger,
affording healthful exercise, but at the same time
immune from the perils of over-exertion, it has
always seemed strange to me that, up to the
present, it has played so small a part in our
national life. An island community, here if
anywhere is a diversion that should surely
appeal to us; and I for one should rejoice
to see the day when, instead of the football
ground and the tennis pitch, our coasts should
be thronged with eager young men and
women enjoying this hygienic and innocent
pastime.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor did we confine ourselves, while at the
sea-side, merely to terrestrial amusement, and
we would frequently indulge, for perhaps a
quarter of an hour, in the enjoyable practice
of pedal immersion. Wholly precluded, of
course, for constitutional reasons, from the
fuller development of this art involved in swimming,
we nevertheless found this to be a most
laughable and even exciting occupation; and I
can recall at least two occasions when, owing
to a momentary inadversion, our rolled-up
trousers became partially submerged. A smart
run home, however, a cup of hot milk, and
immediate retirement to bed sufficed, in both
instances, to protect us from any untoward
results.</p>

<p class='c014'>With my two friends, also, Simeon and Silas
Whey, I had many hours of fruitful companionship.
Equally segregated with myself from
the majority of their schoolfellows, though less
upon moral and intellectual than purely physical
grounds, they were yet earnest and high-minded
lads with many notably endearing qualities.
Reticent to an extreme, partly, in the case of
Silas, owing to an initial difficulty in articulating
anything at all, and in the case of Simeon, owing
to a kind of laryngeal click from which he is still
unfortunately a sufferer, they appeared to find
a comfort in my own natural eloquence that I
was only too glad to bestow upon them. In
return for this, their ample pocket-money was
always entirely at my disposal, and many a
pound of toffee and Turkish delight was I able
to enjoy at their expense. Like myself unaddicted
to athletics, and thereby preserved
from its associated vices, they would saunter
for hours with me discussing some favourite
Bible character or humming in unison some
well-known hymn; and we were further united,
if that were possible, in our eventual confirmation
by the self-same Bishop.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nevertheless, as I have said, it was chiefly
upon myself that I had to depend for company;
and in my walks abroad, my studies of the
shop-windows, and my exploration of the neighbouring
churches, my closest comrade was myself,
and I can honestly say that I have never
regretted it. Nor must it be supposed that the
hours so spent were entirely devoid of legitimate
adventure. On two or three occasions, for
instance, I was abruptly addressed by some
surprised or suspicious verger, and once, owing
to ignorance of its usual closing hours, I was
incarcerated in a local cemetery. Confined by
railings too lofty to scale and too narrowly
approximated to permit egress, for a few
moments the prospects were sufficiently black
to cause a sensible quickening of my pulse.
A felicitous remark, however, addressed to
an under-gardener, secured my exit by a
private gate, and I hurried home, not without
relief, but none the worse for my little mischance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor shall I forget the thrill, perhaps a trifle
guilty, with which I discovered, soon after I was
sixteen, how to descend from a vehicle in motion
without the sacrifice of an erect position.
Hitherto, like my father, when travelling by
tram or omnibus, I had always insisted upon
complete immobility prior both to entrance
into and departure from one of these public
conveyances; and many a conductor had
been reported by us both for failing to
secure the requisite lack of motion. Upon my
sixteenth birthday, however, perceiving that
the omnibus in which I was journeying could
not be brought to a standstill at the desired
position, I decided to alight from it notwithstanding,
and boldly descended from its posterior
step.</p>

<p class='c014'>Naturally leaving this at right angles, what
was my rather rueful amazement to discover
myself, in the next instant, lying upon my side
in the roadway. At first I imagined that I must
have stepped upon something slippery or that
some such article must have been adhering to
my footwear. But a minute examination both
of these and the roadway failed to reveal any
such cause. Completely baffled, I made a second
attempt, but with an equally discomforting
result, and time after time, in spite of my
utmost efforts, I was the victim of a similar loss
of equilibrium. Many a less determined and
timider lad would indeed have given up the
venture, and again I ought to confess, perhaps,
in view of municipal regulations, that my
pertinacity was not wholly defensible.</p>

<p class='c014'>Robbed of candour, however, such a record
as the present would lose the greater part of
its spiritual value; and while I am prepared
to admit that, in this particular instance, my
youthful conduct may have been open to misjudgment,
I cannot concede that it was in any
degree incompatible with the highest expression
of the Xtian character. Refusing to be cast
down, therefore, save in the most literal sense, I
continued dauntlessly with my efforts, to be
rewarded at last with a final success no less
gratifying than entire. Failing to remain upright
in departing from the moving vehicle either
at right angles to it or with my back towards
the driver, I found that by <i>facing in the same
direction</i> I could not only descend from it with
greater immunity, but that by <i>running after it</i>,
as it were, for two or three steps, I could do
so with complete integrity. Needless to say,
having acquired this knowledge, I only made use
of it in an occasional emergency, and for some
years now, owing to declining success, I have
discontinued the practice altogether.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the unfolding of my seventeenth year,
however, I was definitely approaching the great
problems of adult life, and much of my time
now began to be occupied with the contemplation
of my future career. Thanks to the tempered
foresight of my father, a firm believer as a rule
in unlimited families, in the exceptional circumstances
of his own case he had refrained from
further parentage. On his demise, therefore, as
he had given me to understand, I should inherit
some two thousand pounds, this being the
amount to which his insurance and savings
would by then probably have accrued. Should
my mother survive him, I should of course be
expected, and would gladly, as I assured him,
make her some allowance. But her health was
so precarious as to render this sacrifice a very
improbable necessity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Devoid of anxiety, therefore, as to ultimate
no less than immediate penury, I could afford to
regard the future with an adequate deliberation,
and I need scarcely say, perhaps, that the
Church of England was the subject of my first
and most prolonged consideration. Financially
inadequate as were even its highest rewards, I
was yet so adapted to its every need that both
my father and myself would have been willing
to overlook this very serious disadvantage. But
to become ordained presupposed an examination,
and I had been seriously handicapped in this
particular respect by a proven disability, probably
hereditary in origin, to demonstrate my
culture in so confined a form.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a similar reason, even had I been attracted
to it, the profession of Medicine would have been
unavailable, while from that of the Law, nobler
in every way, I was equally precluded. For
some time, however, we canvassed very carefully
the strong claims of Diplomacy, for which
in many ways, as my father agreed with me, I
was most admirably fitted. And I am still
convinced that both as attaché and ambassador
I should have found congenial and Xtian
employment. Unhappily, however, such a
career involved the acquirement of the French
language, with attendant dangers, to which
my father could not persuade himself to expose
me. Whether he was right in this is perhaps
open to argument, and I have since met several
apparently devout men who have not only
spoken this tongue with reported fluency, but
have deliberately sojourned in the country of
its origin. Personally, however, while reluctant
to condemn them, I must confess to sharing my
father’s views, and I am happy in the knowledge
that the vicar of my parish holds precisely the
same opinion. Abandoning Diplomacy, therefore,
we considered the Consolidated Water
Board, in which my father of course had considerable
influence. But here, as in the Church
of England, the emoluments were unsatisfactory,
while the spiritual opportunities, of course, were
far more restricted.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus step by step, as though by the hand of
Providence—and indeed, as my father said, it
could have been by no other hand—we were
slowly led to the conclusion that in some branch
of Commerce lay my future destiny. Requiring
no previous examinations, with liberal, nay
illimitable, monetary possibilities, this was the
field—the highest, perhaps, of all—that was now
unfolded before our gaze. For a few moments,
I remember, we sat there speechless, one on
each side of the parlour table. Then my father
rose and stood for another few moments with
his right hand resting on the harmonium. In
his face there was a great joy, not unmixed with
solemnity. His eyes looked beyond me out
towards eternity. Indeed it was to eternity
that he addressed himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Augustus,” he said, “my son Augustus—a
Xtian tradesman, preferably wholesale.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother came in to announce the supper.
But almost impatiently he motioned her
aside.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, can’t you see,” he cried, “that we’re
standing on Pisgah?”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment, not comprehending him, she
stared at his feet. Then very softly she withdrew,
and he came toward me with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A Xtian magnate,” he said, “a commercial
Xtian—what better could I have desired for
you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Impulsively I kissed him, perhaps a little too
impulsively. But he scarcely flinched as he
received the impact, merely remarking that,
upon the next day, he would present me with
my first razor. Nor did he fail to do so, partly
reminded by myself, and partly by the appearance,
early the next morning, of a slight but
painful urticaria or nettlerash in the region of
our most vehement facial adjustment. But
that was a penalty, as he several times assured
me, that many a father would have been glad
to pay, and one that yielded, in less than a
fortnight, to an inunction embracing the oxide of
zinc.</p>

<p class='c012'>A further vision is vouchsafed to us by Providence. Mr.
Chrysostom Lorton and the sources of his wealth. The
debt owed to me by Mr. Septimus Lorton. Interview
with Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Lorton. Mr. Septimus
Lorton’s disgraceful attitude. My father is compelled
to be frank with him. What I discovered in Greenwich
Park.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Manifestly</span> as it had been Providence that
had thus revealed to us the general sphere of
my future activities, it was no less clearly the
same beneficent Agency that determined their
actual channel; and it has always seemed to
me peculiarly appropriate that the particular
enterprise with which I was to be first connected
should have been suggested to my father during
the process of family prayers.</p>

<p class='c014'>This took place, according to our usual custom,
immediately after the conclusion of our
evening meal and consisted of the singing by
my father and myself of two or three hymns or
sacred choruses, followed by the reading on the
part of my father of a chapter of Holy Scripture,
the whole being concluded by one of those
extemporary prayers in the composition of
which my father was so skilled. For the purposes
of the Scripture reading the volume
generally used was a large Bible inherited by
my father, but on the evening in question, owing
to an accident with some stewed fruit, this was
absent at a neighbouring bookbinder’s. My
father had therefore borrowed with my glad
permission my copy of the Lorton Bible for
Schools, and it was in opening this that he
caught sight of the words “eighteenth edition”
on the first page.</p>

<p class='c014'>That something had perturbed him was
instantly apparent both to my mother and
myself, not only on account of the sudden
tremor that became visible in his left hand but
of the extraordinary rapidity with which he
read the appointed chapter, and the verbal
errors that consequently ensued. His subsequent
prayer too was so brief that we were
scarcely upon our knees before he had leapt to
his feet again, and my mother and myself,
indeed, were still kneeling when he began to
expound the idea that had been vouchsafed
to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have it,” he cried. “It’s just been sent
to me. Chrysostom Lorton. That’s the man.
Eighteen editions—that’s what his Bible’s gone
into, and none of the authors with any royalty
rights!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was that all, for in addition, as I have
said, to being the elder brother of Mr. Septimus
Lorton, he was not only the proprietor of the
well-known <i>Beulah</i>, perhaps the most popular
of weekly religious journals, but his <i>Peeping Up
Series for Children</i>, devotional stories with
coloured illustrations, were familiar objects upon
the nursery book-shelves of every evangelical
household. Moreover he was the medium
through which were issued to the world many
millions of hortatory pamphlets, while the counters
of his show-room in Paternoster Row were
heaped with every kind of Protestant literature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such then was the man and such the undertaking,
not only Xtian but lucrative, that by a
chance gesture, or so it might have seemed,
now stood beckoning before us; and it was
only necessary, as my father justly said, for his
brother Septimus to do the rest. But would
he? I was at first doubtful. A weak man, he
was also inert. And it did not of course follow
that because he used his brother’s Bible he was
on intimate or influential terms with him. This
much was clear, however, that as the oldest
pupil in his school, and in view of the treatment
that I had received from his subordinates, he
was under an obligation to me that neither my
father nor myself could morally allow ourselves
to remit. And although for reasons that I have
already mentioned I had not advanced from
my original class, in the strictly ethical sense,
by his own admission, I was <i>facile princeps</i>.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f4'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Easily first.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“A good boy,” said Mr. Lorton, “a very,
very good boy, or shall we say, now that he
has begun to shave, an extremely admirable
young man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was upon the next evening, the penultimate
evening of my last term at school, when
both my father and myself were sitting in
Mr. Lorton’s study for the purpose indicated
above.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is useless to deny, of course,” my father
had said, “that we have been seriously disappointed
in your school, or to suggest that
either my son or myself will be able to look
back upon it with approval. Nor can I profess
to be wholly convinced as to the necessity that
you have so often explained to me of promoting
your pupils from class to class according to the
results of an examination. At the same time I
am open-minded enough to recognise that this
method has the sanction of custom, and to
forbear from arraigning you for the consequently
meagre position that my son still occupies in
your establishment. Refusing to accept the
standard, I can afford to ignore its results.
But of this, Mr. Lorton, I am completely confident—that
if the index had been a moral or
religious one, my boy Augustus would have
been second to none.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here my father paused for a moment to
expectorate some phlegm, and it was then that
Mr. Lorton used the words I have quoted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A good boy,” he said, as his wife entered
the room, “a very, very good boy, or shall we
say, now that he has begun to shave, an
extremely admirable young man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A heavily-constructed woman of immense
height, with prominent cheek-bones and a bovine
chin, it was generally understood that Mr. Lorton
had selected her chiefly on account of her
income. And neither my father nor myself had
ever been able to detect in her the least sign of
intelligence. Happily her intrusion, however,
was but momentary, and my father was able
once more to proceed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am obliged to you for your tribute,” he
said, “and if, as you must surely admit, my
son’s influence in your school has been inestimable,
you will the more readily agree with me
in adopting a reciprocal attitude towards the
important question of his future employment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As we both observed, Mr. Lorton’s expression
changed a little. But his voice retained its
professional amiability.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, precisely,” he said, “precisely, although
you must understand, of course, that my
influence is strictly limited.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nevertheless,” said my father, “I am depending
on its exertion to the utmost boundary
of its capacity. And I should be glad to learn
what openings you have in view for one to
whom so admittedly you are a debtor.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this point Mrs. Lorton returned and took
up a position on her husband’s left flank.
Mr. Lorton glanced at her before replying.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, of course,” he said, “the problem is
a somewhat difficult one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It would be easier,” said Mrs. Lorton, “if
we were an employment agency.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father bowed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That I fully appreciate,” he said. “But I
may at least assume, I trust, that you have
considered the problem.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, deeply,” said Mr. Lorton, “very deeply,
in fact I ought to say, perhaps, profoundly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father leaned back, folding his arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then may I enquire,” he asked, “with what
result?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again Mr. Lorton glanced at his wife. But
her slab-like face remained unstirred.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I can hardly say,” he replied, “that
as yet—er—we have come to a definite conclusion.
The moral qualities, you see, though
extremely valuable——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“For ultimate salvation,” said my father,
“they are essential.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, of course,” said Mr. Lorton, “of course.
But in the meantime, you know, and taken by
themselves——” He paused for a moment, and
then his face brightened. “Have you ever
thought,” he said, “of making your son a
missionary?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A sort of sigh emanated from his wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In a warm country,” she said, “a long
way off?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton nodded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Healthy but remote,” he said, “where his
moral enthusiasm could have full play?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And where his personal appearance,” said
Mrs. Lorton, “could scarcely fail to be such a
protection to him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quite so,” said Mr. Lorton. “I can conceive
of no one eating dear Augustus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Lorton smiled not unkindly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No one at all,” she said, “not even the
most debased.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Afterwards, as we discovered, these remarks
lacked sincerity. But for the moment we were
not ungrateful. Colouring with pleasure my
father lifted his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am again obliged to you,” he said, “for
your tribute.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton rose to his feet, evidently
under the impression that the interview had
ended.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, not at all,” he said, “not at all, we are
only too happy to have been of any assistance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He moved towards the door. But my father
motioned him back. Somewhat less agreeably,
I thought, he sat down again. Allowing him a
moment for this, my father then proceeded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sensible as I am,” he said, “both of the
justice, and I may say discernment, of your
suggestion, neither on financial nor hygienic
grounds am I able to entertain it; and indeed
in its main outlines the province of
my son’s future has already been delineated
for us. Second to none in my admiration of
the noble calling to which you have referred,
surely they are nobler who have created the
means by which our missionaries subsist, and
who, of the wealth that their efforts have
amassed, continue to support these emissaries
of religion. It is therefore to Commerce that
my son has been called, but in his first introduction
to this sacred field, we have only
thought it right to afford you the opportunity
of being the possible instrument of Providence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see,” said Mr. Lorton. “That is very
kind of you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take away the number,” said his wife,
“that you first thought of.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father stared at her. But she appeared
to be in a kind of stupor, and it seemed more
merciful to avert his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It has in fact occurred to us,” he said, “or
rather to me—for it was to me personally that
the idea was vouchsafed—that your brother
Chrysostom would be glad to hear that my son’s
services were now available.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For two or three moments Mr. Lorton seemed
to struggle for breath. Then he made a meaningless
sound like that of a small animal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My brother C—Chrysostom?” he said at last.
“But in what capacity would you propose to
offer your son?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father smiled somewhat dryly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should hardly have thought offer,” he
said, “was the right word.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Lorton looked at her husband.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He means that dear Augustus,” she said,
“would allow Chrysostom to approach him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Provided,” said my father, “that he gave
sufficient assurances. Of course we should look
forward to an eventual partnership.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And not to succession?” asked Mrs. Lorton.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Only in the event,” said my father, “of
Mr. Chrysostom’s decease.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton wiped his forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s most considerate,” he said, “most
considerate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then perhaps I can rely,” said my father,
“on your taking immediate steps to arrange an
interview for us with your brother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Mr. Lorton shook his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m very sorry,” he replied. “But that’s
quite impossible. For, in the first place, my
brother’s business is a very complicated and
peculiar one, and in the second I regret to say
that I have absolutely no influence with him.
In fact—er—well, to tell the truth, any testimonial
from me would be worse than useless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, worse,” said Mrs. Lorton, “much worse.
And besides, he has no vacancies.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For perhaps a quarter of a minute there was
a dead silence, and then very slowly my father
rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So I am to understand,” he said, “that
you entirely refuse to approach your brother on
my son’s behalf?”</p>

<p class='c014'>With a pitiable gesture Mr. Lorton shrugged
his shoulders, and the clock on the mantelpiece
made an insolent crowing noise. Trembling,
but composed, my father swept it to the floor
together with several of its adjacent ornaments.
Then very quietly, but with increasing emphasis,
he began to address Mr. Lorton. It was a
painful task. It is always a painful task to
confront such a character with its own portrait.
But it was a duty from which, I am proud to
say, I never knew my father to shrink. Nor
did he cease, on the present occasion, until the
last iota of it had been discharged, though such,
as I have shown, was his verbal economy that
this was completed in fifteen minutes. Then
with his hand resting upon my shoulder, for he
was still the taller by two and a half inches, we
turned our backs, as we thought for ever, upon
Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Lorton.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have said for ever. But though, as the
event proved, this was a misjudgment on both
our parts, it must not be assumed that either
my father or myself had lost his self-confidence.
For the moment, it was true, the
path seemed obstructed, the vision obscured,
the end denied. But neither of us doubted that,
by means yet unrevealed, I should be brought
at last to the destined haven, although, as I
must admit, neither of us foresaw the tremendous
speed with which this would be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was the case, however, for when brooding
alone, upon the very next evening, in
Greenwich Park, a familiar voice pierced my
consciousness and suddenly awakened my every
faculty. It was a warm but cloudy April dusk,
and I was sitting upon a seat under a large
chestnut tree, when I began to hear again, to
my disgust and astonishment, the detested voice
of Mr. Septimus Lorton. Rapidly withdrawing
myself behind the tree, I then observed him to
be approaching my seat, evidently engrossed in
his conversation with a medium-sized female
who was accompanying him. For a moment,
as was only natural, I resolved to transport
myself as far as possible from his neighbourhood.
But by some impulse—I realize now, of course,
that this could only have had one origin—I
merely performed perhaps a quarter of a revolution
round the commanding trunk of the chestnut
tree. By this manœuvre, not, I think,
uningenious, I thus concealed myself from his
vision while at the same time conferring upon
myself such possible advantages as might accrue
from observation. Nor was the event to prove
me unjustified. For hardly had he arrived at
the seat that I had vacated when he proceeded,
accompanied by his companion, himself to sit
down upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Being a slow runner my position now was
one of the extremest peril, and in the event of
detection, I could only have relied upon my
happily exceptional vocal powers. But a closer
inspection of Mr. Lorton’s companion and something
in the tones in which he was addressing
her combined in bidding me hold my ground
entirely regardless of personal danger. Indeed
from the beginning, I think, it was less the
physical than the moral contingencies that disturbed
me. For I had instantly recognized, to
my profound discomfort, that the person accompanying
him <i>was not Mrs. Septimus Lorton</i>. A
woman of much slenderer and more graceful
build, she had a pink complexion and hazel
eyes, with a rather large but conceivably alluring
mouth, and a considerable quantity of
yellowish hair. Her name, it appeared, was
Nina, the i being pronounced as if it were an e,
and it was quickly apparent to me that, for the
first time, I was in the presence of the gravest
human vice. Nor have I ever, perhaps, entirely
recovered from the enormous shock of that
discovery. For though I had been aware, of
course, from my studies of Holy Scripture, that
such things had occurred in the Middle East,
and had even deduced from contemporary newspapers
their occasional survival in the British
Islands, I had never dreamed it possible that
here, in a public park in the Xtian London of
my own experience, a married man could thus
openly sit with his arm round a female who
was not his wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>Trembling all over, I was afraid for two or
three moments that I was about to relapse into
unconsciousness, and that I did not do so I can
only attribute to the amazing discovery that
followed. For no sooner had Mr. Lorton
taken his seat than the petrifying fact became
manifest that his fellow-criminal was not only
married herself but <i>was actually the wife of his
brother Chrysostom</i>.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Afterwards, as was inevitable
perhaps, I utterly broke down, but not
until I had made full notes of their conversation,
learned that Mrs. Chrysostom was supposed to
be out shopping, and observed them kiss one
another several times. Then, pale and distraught,
blinded with tears, and scarcely indeed
able to suppress my sobs, I hurried home, and
within less than an hour had buried my face in
my father’s waistcoat.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f5'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I am happy to say that this pernicious family is now
completely extinct.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, father,” I cried, “father,” and though
he had misinterpreted my convulsions, I shall
never forget the tenderness with which he
signalled to my mother to fetch a basin as
quickly as possible. Nor was he less sympathetic
when I had succeeded in convincing him
that my paroxysms were spiritual rather than
gastric, for smoothing my hair with his unoccupied
hand, he at once readjusted my head to its
former position.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor boy,” he said, “my poor Augustus.
Tell me what’s happened. Take your time.
There, there now. I’ve sent your mother away.
But she’s left the basin here in case.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, sin,” I cried, “sin—unbelievable sin in
Greenwich Park.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt my father’s abdomen give a violent
heave.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In Greenwich Park?” he asked. “Never?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes,” I cried, “yes. Would that it
were no. But it was not no.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father bent over me, patting my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor boy,” he said. “What sort of
sin?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, the worst,” I said, “the worst. It was
Mr. Lorton and Mrs. Chrysostom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good Heavens,” said my father, “Mr.
Lorton?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Septimus,” I said, “and Mrs. Chrysostom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what were they doing?” asked my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>Burning all over, I replied that they had
been kissing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kissing,” he said, “kissing? You mean to
tell me you saw them kissing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, father,” I said, “several times, with
mutual expressions of passionate regard.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had now reared my head from the lower
part of his waistcoat, and it would have been
hard to say which of us was the deeper scarlet.
Then my father covered his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mutual expressions?” he whispered. “Do
you remember them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>With a shaking hand I offered him my pocket-book.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are there,” I said. “I wrote them
down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Like a tornado he tore them from my grasp.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My darling,” he read. “Oh, Septimus.
Give me another. Well, just one. My only
darling. Light of my heart. Do you know
what your lips are like? No, tell me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a great light shone in my father’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Providence has delivered them,” he said,
“into our hands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I was silent. Then I rose to
my feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had rather thought,” I said, “that might
be the case.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, it is,” said my father. “It is. Do
you remember those beautiful words of David’s,
‘the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the
vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood
of the wicked’?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not only do I remember them,” I said,
“but had you not quoted them, I should
certainly have done so myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll wash them to-night,” said my father.
“Put on your cap. No, it would perhaps be
better to wear your bowler,” and five minutes
later we were standing once more on the front-door
step of Hopkinson House.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Second interview with Mr. Septimus Lorton. But now the
tables are turned. A pitiful exhibition. My father
demands guarantees. He will write a letter to Mrs.
Chrysostom Lorton. My father’s ordeal. When it was
dark.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Save</span> that it became the means so strangely
selected for my early entrance into Xtian
commerce, I do not propose to linger over the
comparatively brief but effective interview that
ensued. At first refused admission, the words
Greenwich Park sent as a message by the servant
sufficed to bring Mr. Lorton hastily but
reluctantly and unaccompanied to the front
door. From there he conveyed us to one of
the smaller and more distant schoolrooms, and
it soon became obvious, in spite of his tentative
denials, and even more despicable evasions,
that my father and myself were the complete
masters of the situation. It was true, of
course, that he tried to temporize with the
pathetic bravado of the exposed sinner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But even if it were the case,” he said,
“which I am not prepared to admit, that I
was in Greenwich Park with Mrs. Chrysostom,
do you suppose that, were I to deny it, my
brother would believe you for a moment?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Fulfilled as he was with a Xtian indignation,
my father was unable to suppress a smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I imagine that at least,” he said, “he
would be interested in my son’s knowledge
that she was supposed to be shopping in
Kensington.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Septimus Lorton protruded the tip of his
tongue in a vain endeavour to moisten his lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And he would also be interested,” I said,
“to meet the lame newspaper-seller from whom
she obtained change for ten shillings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father nodded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That cannot often happen,” he said, “and
my son tells me that the man picked up one
of her gloves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I said, “and followed her into the
station with it, where she gave him a sixpence,
and he called her a pretty lady.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father looked thoughtfully at the tips
of his fingers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“From which I infer,” he said, “that he
could probably identify her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton passed one of his hands over the
pale green surface of his cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear sir,” he said, “my dear sir,
even suppose, I say, that without—er—prejudice,
Mrs. Chrysostom had so far honoured me
as to accompany me for a walk in the park
you mention, surely that is not necessarily an
indiscreet act in view of the fact that I am her
husband’s brother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again my father smiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But a brother, you must remember, whose
testimonial would be worse than useless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment Mr. Lorton glanced from side
to side with the bestial expression of a hunted
rat. Then he spoke huskily, after licking his
lips again and listening for a second or two over
his left shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps I was rather hasty,” he said,
“rather hasty. In fact I had—er—already
begun to reconsider that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am happy to hear it,” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In fact,” said Mr. Lorton, “I think something
could be done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father bowed again. He was no longer
smiling. I had seldom, indeed, seen him look
so grave.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For the sake of your school,” he said, “to
say nothing of your soul, and for the sake of
your brother’s business, I sincerely hope so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I think so,” said Mr. Lorton, “I think
so. Now, let me see. How could I be most
helpful?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Deeply as I am inclined,” he said, “to
expose this iniquity to the uttermost, and
irreparable as has been its injury to my son’s
sensibilities, I am yet prepared to concede you
the opportunity of retaining at least the semblance
of your good name. But for my son I
must claim every guarantee. Upon my son’s
future your own is dependent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I dare not record that Mr. Lorton smiled.
Let me rather say that he exposed his incisors.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Augustus,” he said, “I’m sure he’ll
succeed. I’ll send a line to my brother’s
wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father’s expression never changed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you apprehend then,” he inquired,
“that she can secure him the requisite position?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Far more probably,” said Mr. Lorton,
“than I. My—er—Mr. Chrysostom Lorton is
deeply attached to her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father’s silence was perhaps more eloquent
than any merely verbal condemnation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I—er—I’ll write to-night,” said Mr. Lorton.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps,” said my father, “you’d be so
kind as to give us Mrs. Chrysostom Lorton’s
address.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton hesitated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh—er—certainly,” he said. “Paternoster
Towers, Enfield.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father made a note of this in his diary.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shall call upon her,” he said, “to-morrow
at noon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Lorton emitted a sort of gargling sound.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I—er—I’ll tell her,” he said. “She’ll be
delighted.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Strong in the Lord, therefore, and indeed in
comparatively good spirits considering the vileness
with which we had been brought into
contact, we returned home to a belated but
none the less substantial meal; and it was not
until this had been absorbed and my mother
was in the scullery, cleansing the dishes that
had contained it, that my father referred again
to the interview that had been arranged for the
following day.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Although it seemed wise,” he said, “to
suggest to that creature that both you and I
would be present at it, I am afraid that my
obligations to the Consolidated Water Board
will in reality prevent me from being there, and
that you must be prepared therefore, my
dear Augustus, to face that female alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I pray that you may trust me,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a slightly increased colour my father
rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have no doubt of it,” he said. “But at
the same time—at the same time—oh, Augustus,
Augustus!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Deeply moved, he advanced two or three
paces and leaned heavily against the harmonium.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see, my boy,” he continued—at what
a cost I could only afterwards guess “with
this interview you will be definitely entering
upon a new and most perilous phase of experience.
For the first time—I must ask you to
turn down the lamp—for the first time, as a
marriageable adult, you will be called upon to
encounter, face to face, a woman of fierce and
unbridled passions.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here he paused for a moment and I could
feel the floor shaking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, father,” I cried. “Can I not spare
you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” he said. “I must see it through.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bent forward to steady the lamp, and at
the same time I turned it lower.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mind the wick,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, father,” I cried, “do you mean that
she may want to kiss me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Augustus,” he said, “or even more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, father,” I cried. “Is there anything
more?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He swallowed once or twice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Augustus,” he said.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Effect upon my father of his disclosure. My Xtian confidence
in journeying to Enfield. Paternoster Towers and its
mistress. Unfortunate detachment of my posterior
trouser-buttons. Triumphant success of my interview.
A kindly parlourmaid and her male friend. I secure a
position under Mr. Chrysostom Lorton. Melancholy
death of Silas Whey.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Profoundly</span>, and indeed permanently, as it
had shaken him—when I turned up the lamp
again my father was an old man—I cannot say
that the substance of his communication was
entirely unfamiliar to me, or that I had not
been aware, to a certain extent, of a new significance
attaching to my person. Appreciably
over five feet in height, with a pectoral girth of
twenty-six inches, my abdominal measurement
(fully clothed of course) was but little less than
a yard, and for some time I had been unable to
help noticing that I was not unattractive to the
opposite sex. I had in fact deemed it advisable
to inform Emily Smith, who, as I have said,
was somewhat my senior, that while I was still
agreeable to remain her companion, there could
be no question between us of ultimate matrimony;
and I had several times discussed with
Simeon and Silas Whey the qualities to be
demanded from a possible wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even had I not been fortified, therefore, with
the details, imparted at such a price to me by
my father, I should not have felt myself wholly
unequipped in confronting Mrs. Chrysostom
Lorton; and, as it was, I made the journey to
Enfield serene in the knowledge of my instructed
manhood. This was the more fortunate in
that, devoid of anxiety, I was enabled to profit
very fully from an expedition considerably the
most involved that I had ever engaged upon
unaccompanied.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing would have been easier, for instance,
than, dazed by its magnitude, to have wandered
for hours in Liverpool Street Station, whereas
a few courteous and clearly-phrased questions
soon led my footsteps to the appropriate platform.
Similarly, had I been engrossed with a
fearful apprehension of the ordeal that awaited
me, I might have been blind to the interesting
objects that presented themselves to my carriage
window; whereas I was moved to pity
and apprehension by the rough streets of
Bethnal Green, pricked to audible curiosity by
the uncommon nomenclature of Seven Sisters,
agreeably reminded, at Bruce Grove, of the
well-known Caledonian monarch, and so overcome
by mirth, as we drew into Lower
Edmonton, at a sudden recollection of John
Gilpin that an elderly female who was sitting
opposite me hastily left the compartment.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was able to observe, too, with satisfaction
the busy and prosperous aspect of Enfield, and
although, as I drew near to the mansion of
Mr. Chrysostom Lorton, I was naturally a little
sobered by the imminence of my task, I was
gratified to perceive in Paternoster Towers a
concrete testimony to the worth of his enterprise.
Solidly constructed of red brick and
surrounded by well-trimmed lawns and flower-beds,
it was further adhered to by a couple of
large conservatories and approached by a broad,
gravelled drive. Nor was I less satisfied by the
humble and respectful demeanour of the good-looking
parlourmaid who opened the door, and
who had proceeded, having taken my hat and
stick, to admit me to her mistress’s boudoir.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Lorton,” she said, “will be down in a
minute.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thank you,” I replied. “I will await her
arrival.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Favourably as I had been impressed, however,
it must not be assumed that I had in any
degree relaxed my guard; and though I was
aware, of course, that I held every advantage
I made a rapid survey of the contents of the
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of no great size, it had evidently been furnished
to minister almost entirely to the senses,
and it was perhaps not surprising that I was
unable to discern a single text upon its walls.
Upon a parquet floor polished to a degree that
was almost lascivious in its smoothness, elaborate
table-legs stood reflected and a voluptuous
rug or two solicited the feet. Upon the mantelpiece
stood an oval mirror, indecently surrounded
by likenesses of Cupid, and beside it
a nude female, fashioned in bronze, was
extracting a thorn from her left calf. Flushing
involuntarily, I turned away from these only
to observe upon a French-looking writing-table
a large photograph of an elderly man,
pathetically signed “Your aff. Chrysostom.”
Beneath this, in a confusion that was probably
characteristic, lay a half-finished letter to somebody
called Loo-Loo and several others addressed
to “Dearest Nina” that I did not hesitate to
peruse. Most of these, as I discovered, were
but little more than the vapid productions of
obvious worldlings. But two were invitations
to card parties and one, to my horror, contained
the word “blasted.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was the one, indeed, upon which I was
engaged when the door of the room was abruptly
thrown open with a lack of refinement that I
ought perhaps to have expected, but that for
a moment completely unnerved me. In fact
it did more. For in the effort to recover myself
the rug upon which I was standing slid
across the floor leaving behind it not only the
upper and middle but the lower middle portions
of my frame. Poised in mid-air, my feet
having accompanied the rug, I was entirely
unable to support these, and was obliged in
consequence to assume with the extremest
suddenness a sedentary position upon the parquet.
Nor was that all. For when, at the
third attempt, I succeeded in once more
standing upright, the left of my two posterior
trouser-buttons fell with a sharp metallic sound
upon the floor. Here it paused for a moment,
and then standing upon its circumference followed
the rug in the direction of Mrs. Lorton.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear me,” she said, “I’m afraid I interrupted
you. Is this your button?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She stooped and picked it up.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a supreme effort, and despite the most
poignant anguish, I regained command of
myself and requested her to return it. Hardly
had she done so, however, when there came a
second metallic sound, and the comrade of the
first button also rolled to her feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, dear,” she said, “isn’t that the other
one? What do you suppose will happen
now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Only those who have experienced the extreme
discomfort of the simultaneous loss of both
posterior trouser-buttons, and the consequent
approach to the back of the neck of the bifurcation-point
of the braces, will be able to appreciate
the enormous handicap under which
Providence had now seen fit to place me. In
the manual effort, too, which became instantly
necessary to prevent the downward corrugation
of my trousers, the first button slipped
from my grasp and again bounced upon the
parquet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I say,” said Mrs. Lorton, “is this a
new kind of game, or are you trying to put
me at my ease?”</p>

<p class='c014'>With a silent but powerful petition, I drew
myself as erect as the circumstances permitted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is neither a game,” I said, holding up
my trousers, “nor am I entering into personal
relations with you. In fact it is my duty to
make it quite clear to you that you are no
sort of temptation to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Clad in some close-fitting fabric that exuded
a most licentious scent, I could see at once
that these well-chosen words had had a profound
and immediate effect upon her. Turning
her back on me, she emitted a hoarse gasp, and
then collapsing upon the sofa, she lay there
choking and convulsed in what appeared to
be an attack of acute hysteria. Startled but
unmoved, and still sustaining my trousers, I
gravely awaited her recovery.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear,” she said, wiping her eyes, and
then after looking at me again, she collapsed
once more. Then she sat up, fanning herself
with her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must really forgive me,” she said,
“but you looked so stern.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should scarcely have thought,” I replied,
inclining my head a little, “that as a Xtian
gentleman you could have expected me to look
otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no,” she said, “no, of course not. Just
suppose—oh dear, oh dear.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she wiped her eyes again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wouldn’t you be better sitting down?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thank you,” I said. “But I prefer to
stand.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She folded up her handkerchief and placed it
in a small bag.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, you know best,” she said. “What
do you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had imagined,” I said, “that that had
already been indicated to you by your fellow-accomplice,
Mr. Septimus Lorton.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I say,” she replied, “you do use long words.
Aren’t you considered to be frightfully clever?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In my own circle,” I said, “I am not considered,
I believe, to be unintelligent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so you want Chrys,” she said, “to
give you a job?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are doubtless aware,” I replied, “of
the alternative.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mean if he doesn’t,” she said, “you’ll
tell him about me and Septimus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As a Xtian gentleman,” I said, “it would
become my duty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder what he’d say,” she said. “When
do you want to see him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The sooner the better,” I said. “I should
prefer this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She rose to her feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I’ll have to write him a note,” she
said. “But it’ll never do to mention poor
Septimus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She crossed to the writing-table and began
nibbling her pen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course it’s rather difficult,” she said,
“to know what to tell him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed again, a trifle grimly perhaps.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The way of transgressors,” I reminded her,
“is seldom easy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I suppose not,” she said. “How clever
you are. Aren’t they frightfully proud of you
at home?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I trust,” I said, “that I have deserved
their affection.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I’m sure of it,” she replied. “Now
let me see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She frowned for a moment and then began
writing in a peculiarly large and childish
hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course I’ll have to tell him,” she said,
“that you were at Septimus’s school, where
you were frightfully struck with the Lorton
Bible, but that you didn’t like Septimus—that’ll
be sure to please him—and so you didn’t
ask him to help you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her face began to brighten as she put this
on paper, and I noticed that she was protruding
the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So you came here all by yourself, thinking
he’d be at home, as it was the Easter holidays,
and when you found he wasn’t, you asked to
see me instead, and I was most frightfully
taken up with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here she made a blot, but observed that it
didn’t matter, and then pronounced each word
as she slowly inscribed it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He seems a most lovable and religious
young man, and I do hope you’ll help him all
you can. Cross, cross, cross—those are for
kisses—your ever loving and devoted Nina.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she handed me the letter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There you are,” she said. “Now you’ll
know exactly what you’ll have to tell him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Releasing one of my hands, I read it quickly
but carefully and returned it to her without
comment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will it do?” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can only hope,” I replied, “that, for
your own sake, madam, it will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She put it into an envelope and handed it
back to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I mustn’t detain you,” she said,
“any longer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor did I wish to stay. But I was now face
to face with a situation of the utmost difficulty.
Growingly repugnant as was this woman’s
presence to me, and singularly complete as had
been my moral triumph, both my posterior
trouser-buttons were still lying upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I see,” she said, “would you like to
take them with you? I’ll put them in an
envelope and then you won’t lose them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She accordingly did so, handing me the
envelope, which I quickly took from her and
placed in my pocket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see, I’m afraid,” she said, “that I
could hardly trust myself to—to actually sew
them on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed to her coldly, ignoring the split
infinitive.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor should I have seen fit,” I said, “to
concede you the opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Obviously shamed, she lowered her eyes, and
to hide her confusion rang the bell, and I am
glad to acknowledge that the entrance of the
good-looking parlourmaid was not wholly unwelcome
to me. Though but a menial, I had
already discovered in her some of the most
desirable female qualities, and I am happy to
record that in a moment of acute anxiety, she
played an humble but not unworthy part.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Lorton turned to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Parker,” she said, “poor Mr. Carp
has had a most unfortunate accident.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Parker glanced at my hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, that’s the trouble,” said Mrs. Lorton.
“Isn’t it awkward for him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Parker looked at me with genuine sympathy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, poor gentleman,” she said, “it must be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see,” said Mrs. Lorton, “as a Xtian
gentleman he’s quite unable to let them go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh quite,” said Parker, “quite—except for
a moment, perhaps, just to get a firmer hold.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Lorton opened the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So perhaps you’ll help him,” she said,
“all you can.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Parker glanced at her inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I mean, put his stick under his arm and
his hat on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, gladly,” said Parker, “ever so gladly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And escort him down the drive and open
the front gate for him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Preceded by Parker, therefore, I left the
room, and though it was perhaps unfortunate
that there were two other servants in the hall,
at Parker’s request one of them brought my
hat, which Parker herself put on my head,
while the other inserted my walking-stick,
handle foremost, beneath my left arm-pit.
Thanking them graciously, but without undue
familiarity, and once again preceded by Parker,
I then moved down the drive, of which this
gentle domestic opened the front gate for me.
Nor was that the last service that she was
privileged to render me, for acting upon a
suggestion that she had obligingly volunteered,
I visited a tailor in Enfield High Street to
whom, as I soon discovered, she hoped to be
betrothed. An admirable young man, he had
not as yet made up his mind as to whether it
would be discreet to grant her request, but he
was happy to provide me with two entirely
new buttons and personally to affix them to
the brink of my trousers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Completely restored, then, in respect of my
clothes, and physically recuperated with some
excellent buns, I was enabled to assimilate the
scenes of my return journey with an even
keener appreciation, and to arrive at Paternoster
Row in the full confidence of final success.
Not having a visiting-card, I had made up my
mind to announce myself as a messenger from
Mrs. Chrysostom; and, as it proved, this was
the means of securing me an almost immediate
audience. A somewhat short and extremely
stout man with a heavily-coloured face and
a drooping grey moustache, Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton, whom I recognized from his photograph,
might rather have been a general than
a man of commerce; and I cannot say that a
first inspection of him gave me entire satisfaction.
Undoubtedly well-dressed, with a
serpentine gold ring encasing the lower portion
of each third finger, I was rather disagreeably
affected both by his bushy and protruding
eyebrows as well as by his attitude towards a
slight mischance associated with the inception
of our interview. For in presenting the envelope,
with which I had assured him Mrs.
Chrysostom had entrusted me, I unfortunately
in the first place handed him the one in which
she had placed my posterior trouser-buttons.
For a moment he stared at them with bulging
eyeballs, and then I regret to say that he
apparently forgot himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good God,” he said, “what the hell—crumph,
crumph—what do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Equally surprised, I have always been glad
to remember that I was the first to recover my
equanimity. Laughing merrily, I handed him
the second envelope—in point of bestowal, of
course, the first.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Although you must not assume,” I said,
“that my natural mirth in any degree condones
your involuntary blasphemy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Condones my what?” he said. “Crumph,
crumph. But how the devil did she get hold of
them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Still clinging to the original envelope, whose
texture he obviously recognized, his globular
eyes continued to be focussed on the two
buttons before him. Briefly I explained to him
the circumstances of their detachment. But
for a considerable time he kept referring to
the subject.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t like it,” he said, “I don’t like it at
all. It’s not seemly. It might have been very
serious.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a new suspicion darkened his countenance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose I may assume,” he said, “that
you’ve had them replaced?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“By a tailor in Enfield,” I said, “who was
incidentally a great admirer of you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His face cleared a little.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Mr. Chrysostom Lorton</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Eh, what?” he said. “An admirer, you
say? What was his name?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I informed him and he nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, yes, yes,” he said, “a worthy young
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>By an auspicious chance too—if indeed it were
one—a female clerk now entered the room,
bearing in her hands a specimen copy of the
nineteenth edition of the Bible for Schools.
He glanced up from his wife’s letter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes,” he said, “that will interest you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing,” I replied, “could have interested
me more, unless perhaps a specimen of the
twentieth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Afterwards, as I shall show, my initial distrust
of the man proved to have been only too
well founded. But, as matters turned out on
this particular afternoon, I left his office as a
junior assistant. Placed under the charge of
the show-room manager, I was to help this
gentleman with his accounts and to act when
necessary as a salesman of the firm’s congenial
and Xtian literature. It was a supreme moment—it
was perhaps, in a good many ways, the
supremest moment of my life—and I did not
hesitate, after some further buns, to make
suitable acknowledgment of it in St. Paul’s
Cathedral. Nor was the news with which I
was confronted on my return to Angela Gardens
entirely able to counteract the deep satisfaction
with which it filled me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nevertheless it was perhaps a timely reminder
of the ever-present imminence of eternity, and
it was certainly one that I have made a point of
recalling in many subsequent moments of elation.
For hardly had I opened the front gate when
somebody touched me on the shoulder, and
turning round, I observed Simeon Whey looking
more preoccupied than I had ever seen him.
His lips at any rate were moving rather convulsively
and his laryngeal spasm was extremely
marked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kck,” he said. “It’s Silas.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear me,” I replied. “What’s the matter
with him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kck,” he repeated. “He’s dead.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t say so?” I cried. “What did
he die of?”</p>

<p class='c014'>For some seconds he was unable to speak,
obviously struggling with his vocal cords, and
then with a blast of exceptional sadness he
managed to expel the mournful details. Suffering,
as it appeared, from a temporary gastric
distention, the amiable lad had gone to the
medicine chest, where he had unfortunately
mistaken the cyanide of potassium for the
bicarbonate of soda.</p>

<p class='c012'>Precautionary measures on entering commercial life. I join

of prayer-meetings. I join the <i>A.D.S.U.</i> Personal

five sisters. Predicament of Ezekiel Stool on the fifth of
November. A timely instance of presence of mind. I am
invited to a meal at the Stools’ residence. A foreshadowing
of sinister events.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a distressing end. Few things are more
distressing, indeed, than the sudden demise of
a potential clergyman. And for the first three
or four days of my work in Paternoster Row my
spirits were appreciably clouded. Nevertheless
I was happy not only that I had embarked upon
the career so satisfactorily chosen for me, but
also in the consciousness that, but for my own
perspicacity, Providence would have found it
difficult to assist me. Moreover it was an
additional comfort to me to reflect that, during
my upward progress in the firm, I should have
the obligatory if unwilling support of Mrs.
Chrysostom Lorton. A word in the ear of her
husband, and her infamy could be no longer
concealed, and I could not suppose that, callous
as she was, she would dare to expose herself to
such an event.</p>

<p class='c014'>Few young men, therefore, can have entered
business life better equipped or so advantageously
placed, and had I in consequence been
carried away a little, it would scarcely perhaps
have been unnatural. Very fortunately, however,
and thanks in a great degree to the
character-forming incidents already related, I
realized from the outset that I was now definitely
committed to the most critical period of
a young man’s life—namely, the years, so fatal
to the vast majority, between his seventeenth
and twenty-fourth birthdays. Then it is, alas,
that intoxicated with the knowledge that he
has become, in my father’s phrase, a marriageable
adult that he begins to resort for the first
time to the tobacconist and the publican—to
buy the cigarette that will so inevitably lure him
into loose and licentious company, and the
fermented liquor that will only too surely
encase him in a drunkard’s coffin.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor is that all. For it is in these same
years, turning aside from the pleasures of
home—from such innocent round games as
Conceal the Thimble or the less familiar Up
Jenkins, or from the happy singing round the
family harmonium of such an humorous glee
as Three Blind Mice—that he enters the Pit (so
appropriately named) of some garish and
degrading theatre.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a sorrowful spectacle. But happily for
my own sake, I had already been so deeply
saddened by it that I had long since resolved,
when the necessity should arise, to take every
possible precaution. No sooner, therefore, had
I obtained my appointment than I hastened to
enroll myself as a member of the Peckham
Branch of the Non-Smokers’ League as well as
of the Kennington Division of the Society for
the Prohibition of the Strong Drink Traffic.
Congenial in every way, I not only discovered
in these an enormous sphere for the exercise of
my influence, but the membership of both
societies conferred the privilege of wearing a
small badge or bone medallion.</p>

<p class='c014'>A slightly convex and circular plaque to be
pinned on the lapel of the wearer’s coat, the
token of membership of the Non-Smokers’
League was about an inch in diameter. Of a
pale cream colour, it was tastefully wreathed
with dark blue lilies, symbolic of purity, the
centre of it being occupied with the initials
<i>N.S.L.</i> boldly imprinted in the same colours.
No less decorative to the wearer than intriguing
to the beholder, a reply to the question
so often put as to what the initials <i>N.S.L.</i>
stood for frequently afforded a valuable opportunity
for soul-intercourse on the subject of
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was the medallion of the Society for the
Prohibition of the Strong Drink Traffic either
less attractive or efficient as an instigator of
fruitful converse. Slightly larger—its diameter
was an inch and a quarter—its ground-work
was of an olive green, the letters <i>S.P.S.D.T.</i>
richly emerging from this in an ingenious
monogram of canary yellow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Into the work of these societies I now threw
myself with all the vehemence at my command,
and had soon forced myself into the innermost
councils of the local branch of each. Meeting
every fortnight in a neighbouring church hall,
the Peckham Branch of the Non-Smokers’
League did not confine itself merely to the
organization of these central gatherings. Valuable
as they were in providing a pulpit for
lectures upon nicotine-poisoning and its attendant
evils, we rightly regarded the outside
world as the main field of our endeavours.
Provided with such strikingly headed pamphlets
as <i>A Gentleman or a Chimney?</i> or the even
more dramatic and spiritually searching <i>Your
Soul or Your Cigar?</i> we would range the streets
addressing obvious smokers, or station ourselves
upon the pavement in the neighbourhood
of tobacconists’ shops. In this way,
though frequently required to endure verbal
persecution, I am proud to believe that the
work performed by us was both timely and
enduring.</p>

<p class='c014'>Working on lines that were somewhat similar,
the Kennington Division of the <i>S.P.S.D.T.</i>
held monthly re-unions for the purpose of
communally denouncing the use of alcohol;
and here we would discuss, over cups of tea and
slices of plain but palatable cake, the results of
our labours during the previous four weeks
and our plans for the four immediately ensuing.
Appreciably more dangerous, in that
we deemed it our duty to distribute literature
at the doors of Public Houses, whence there
would emerge in depressingly large numbers
combative men of considerable size, we never
embarked upon this particular mission save in
groups of four or five, each member being provided
with a police whistle in addition to his
parcel of appropriate leaflets.</p>

<p class='c014'>Admirably illustrated, these bore such arresting
titles as <i>Passing the Poison</i> or <i>From Beer to
Bier</i>, two of the most efficient being <i>The Dram
Drinker’s Downfall</i>, and <i>Virtue versus Vertigo</i>.
That all these works, like those of the <i>N.S.L.</i>,
were published by the firm of Chrysostom
Lorton was of course an additional and pleasurable
inducement to further their disposal in
every way. And although as yet this could not
result for me in any direct financial advantage,
it must be remembered that at this time
there was still every prospect of its eventually
doing so.</p>

<p class='c014'>To thousands of my readers, slacker in fibre,
or not so resolute in the pursuit of goodness, it
may well seem now as if these activities must
have exhausted my spiritual capacity. But
this was not the case, and conscious as I was—it
would have been an affectation to deny it—of my
very rapidly increasing ability for both religious
and commercial leadership, I took every opportunity
of developing my unchallenged gift of
self-expression. Thus, within a year of my
business advent, I had not only addressed both
the foregoing societies, but I had become a
familiar and, I trust, welcome figure at every
local prayer-meeting.</p>

<p class='c014'>I use the word welcome, because I had not
only discerned in these gatherings an admirable
vehicle of elocutionary progress, but I had
quickly discovered in them a crying need that
it was plainly my duty to supply. Familiar to
every frequenter of the average prayer-meeting,
whether Church of England or Non-conformist,
this was nothing less than the presence of a gap-filler,
especially in the earlier stages of the
proceedings. Few can have failed, for example,
to notice the pause that almost invariably takes
place after the Chairman has delivered his own
petition and invited the efforts of further
supplicants. Painful in itself, in that it so
often accentuates the respiratory difficulties of
those present, how often is it broken, alas, by
the simultaneous commencement of two or more
separate competitors? Nor is that all. For,
each realizing that he is too late, a disheartened
silence generally ensues, only to be broken
perhaps by a second neck-to-neck effort on the
part of all the previous starters that abortively
collapses again on some such unfortunate phrase
as “Oh dear, oh Lord.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was here then that I descried, and at once
began to work, an almost virgin field, never
allowing an instant to elapse after the right to
supplicate had been declared general. Indeed
on many occasions I filled the subsequent gaps
also, and at one particularly reluctant gathering,
I can well remember, in less than an hour,
offering a dozen full-length petitions. That I
soon had rivals goes without saying. Who, in
such a position, could have escaped them?
But once started, I allowed no second petitioner
to deflect or abbreviate my entreaties.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps the work, however, in which I was
most interested was that of the Anti-Dramatic
and Saltatory<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Union founded by Ezekiel Stool,
the son of Abraham Stool, the inventor and
proprietor of Stool’s Adult Gripe Water. Probably
the most persistent and unflinching opponent
that the theatre and dancing saloon have
ever known, he was then some twenty-six years
of age and of a very remarkable and beautiful
character. Indeed all that he lacked of these
two qualities in his actual physical appearance
seemed to have been concentrated with additional
force in his spiritual personality. No
taller than myself, and weighing considerably
less, he had suffered all his life from an inherent
dread of shaving, and the greater portion of
his face was in consequence obliterated by a
profuse but gentle growth of hair. His voice
too, owing to some developmental defect, had
only partially broken; and indeed his father
Abraham (afterwards removed to an asylum)
had on more than one occasion attempted to
sacrifice him, under the mistaken impression
that he was some sort of animal that would be
suitable as a burnt offering.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f6'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Appertaining to dancing.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Regarded as a character, however, and when
he had fully assured himself that he was not
in the presence of a theatre-goer or dancer, it
would have been difficult to imagine a more
affectionate or deeply trustful companion;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
and many an hour we spent together combating
the drama, both in Central London and the
suburbs. Well provided with money, thanks
to the sales of the Gripe Water—an excellent
remedy to which I have frequently had recourse—he
had himself composed and caused to be
printed several extremely powerful leaflets.
Of these perhaps the best were <i>The Chorus
Girl’s Catastrophe</i> and <i>Did Wycliffe Waltz?</i>
and these we would distribute in large numbers
among the degenerate pleasure-seekers standing
outside theatres. Purchasing seats, too, we
would ourselves from time to time enter these
buildings, rising in our places when the curtain
was drawn up and audibly rebuking the performers.
Needless to say, having registered
our protest, we would then immediately leave
the premises, not always immune from the
coarse objurgations of obviously interested
minions.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f7'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was far otherwise, alas, in later years.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Nor were we less vigorous in our onslaught
upon the equally prevalent sin of dancing, either
personally attending or stationing delegates at
the entrances to halls or private houses, and
endeavouring if possible by individual appeals
to warn or deter would-be malefactors. An
uphill task, it was not for us to say to how great
an extent we may have succeeded, but I can
remember at least twelve persons, male and
female, who promised to consider what we had
pointed out to them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Deeply as I appreciated, however, the opportunity
of furthering this valuable and congenial
work, I had not as yet realized the ultimate
object that an inscrutable Providence had in
view, or that in Ezekiel Stool I had already
been handed the compass that was destined to
lead my steps to matrimony. Such was the
case, however, little as I then dreamed it, and
even less, if such a thing were possible, was I
attracted, on a first acquaintance, to any of his
five sisters. Simply divided into twins and
triplets, these were all younger than Ezekiel
himself, the triplets being then twenty-four, and
the twins three years younger. None of them
was married, and indeed, as regarded the
triplets, this was scarcely perhaps to be wondered
at. For though they had been interestingly
named by their father as Faith, Hope, and
Charity, they were plain girls, deeply marked
by the smallpox, and of rather less than the
average intelligence. Nor indeed were the
twins, Tact and Understanding, at all remarkable
for personal beauty, and the toes of one of
them, as I was afterwards to discover, were
most unfortunately webbed. On the other
hand, they were kindly, domestic creatures.
All five of them could play the piano. And the
heart of each, as they have frequently told me,
was profoundly stirred by my first visit.</p>

<p class='c014'>Little as I shared, however, though I could
not fail to perceive, the cardiac exaltation of
these five females, I have always looked back
to that first visit with a very considerable
degree of pleasure, and not the less so because
of the preliminary service that I was able to
render their brother Ezekiel. Indeed it was
this that led to an invitation to share the
evening meal at the Stools’ house, a substantial
residence with a large garden, about five
minutes’ walk from Camberwell Green.</p>

<p class='c014'>A November dusk, some eighteen months or
so after my entrance into commercial life, I
had forgotten that it was the anniversary of
the attempt of Guy Fawkes to destroy the
Upper Chamber of our Legislature, and my
thoughts were engaged upon other matters as I
began to walk home from the omnibus stopping-place.
I had hardly walked a hundred yards,
however, when my attention was suddenly
attracted to a somewhat vociferous group of
boys, in the midst of whom, to my surprise and
anxiety, I saw my friend Ezekiel Stool. For a
moment I was at a loss both as how to proceed
and the possible reason for the conclave. But
a moment later I discovered that the position
was no less disturbing than grotesque. Doubtless
intoxicated with the memories of the
day, these ignorant and turbulent youths had
apparently discerned in my friend Ezekiel a
resemblance to the conspirator of 1605. Nay,
they had gone further. They had professed to
perceive in him an actual reincarnation of the
original miscreant, and this in spite of the fact
that Ezekiel had repeatedly explained to them
that he had no knowledge of pyrotechnics.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Believe me,” he had said, “I am neither
the man you mention, nor do I resemble any
authentic portrait of him. Nor have I placed
explosives under anybody’s chamber either in
London or the Provinces.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Despite his denials, however, supported as
they were by references to prominent local
residents, the group of vociferators was quickly
growing both in numbers and excitement, and
several suggestions were being audibly made
that he should be exterminated by fire. It was
a moment for action, and I took it. Fortunately
my police whistle was in my pocket. And
in the next instant I was blowing blast upon blast
to the utmost capacity of my lung power. The
effect was immediate. For scarcely had the
boys dispersed when three or four constables
arrived on the scene, all of them breathless
from the act of running, but carrying their
truncheons in their hands. Being breathless
too, I could only point at Ezekiel, and for the
first moment they misunderstood me, rapidly
surrounding him, as he leaned against a lamp-post,
and lifting their truncheons above their
heads. Once again therefore it was a moment
for action, and once again I took it. Throwing
myself in front of him, I shouted to them to
forbear, and then very briefly I explained what
had happened. Unfortunately, as I have said,
the boys had already dispersed. But then, as
I pointed out to them, that had been my
object, and the fact that this had taken place
before their arrival was no reflection upon their
courage. I cannot record, however, that their
reception of this news was either Xtian or even
courteous, and it was a very great relief both
to myself and Ezekiel when these powerful professionals
at last went away. Nevertheless, as
Ezekiel said, I had probably twice saved his
life, and during the evening meal, to which he
at once invited me, both his parents and his
five sisters repeatedly expressed their satisfaction.
Mr. Abraham Stool, indeed, who had
not then been segregated, but who was already
under the impression that he was the Hebrew
patriarch, several times insisted upon my
approaching him and placing my hand under
his left thigh, after which he would offer me, in
addition to Mrs. Stool, a varying number of
rams and goats.</p>

<p class='c014'>Needless to say, I declined to accept these,
and a week or two later, as I have already
indicated, it was deemed advisable, owing to
his tendency to sacrifice, to place him in other
and remoter surroundings. But it was a happy
evening, during which, as I shall always remember,
Ezekiel Stool expressed his regret that my
father and myself were not fellow-worshippers
with them at St. Nicholas, Newington Butts.
Satisfied as we were, however, with St. James-the-Least-of-All,
where my father had now
become senior sidesman, we had seen no reason,
as I was obliged to point out to him, for again
transferring our worship; and little did I dream
that even as I was speaking those sinister events
were already shaping themselves that were
ultimately to unite us—their only redeeming
outcome—in this new and closer bond.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Design for my grandfather’s tomb. Death and interment
of Mrs. Emily Smith and the aunt that had stood with
my mother’s mother at the bottom of the stairs. Effect
upon my father’s health. Alexander Carkeek and his
sons. Arrival home from the Stools. First tidings of
the new lectern. My father’s interview with the vicar.
Curious instance of transposition of consonants. My
father rehearses his denunciation. Arrival of Simeon
Whey. My father repeats his denunciation.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Permanently</span> impaired as had been my father’s
health by the ordeal referred to in Chapter VIII
he had not permitted this, as I have said, to
interfere with his duties as a sidesman; and
there were still occasions upon which he would
exhibit all his old-time fire and determination.
Thus when my mother’s parents had been
destroyed by a tram accident about a month
after the decease of Silas Whey, it was he who
had arranged the funeral, chosen the hymns,
and designed the monument by which they
were to be commemorated. The provision business
having declined somewhat, the chief factor
in the design had necessarily been one of
economy, and my father had therefore confined
himself to a broken column some three inches
in diameter and a foot high. Insufficient to
accommodate their full names, their initials
had been tastefully engraved upon it, the
surface of the grave being sprinkled with
flints that would require no subsequent upkeep.</p>

<p class='c014'>In conjunction with Mr. Balfour Whey too,
it was he who had selected a house for my
mother’s eight sisters, small but sufficient and
in a remote part of Wales, where they would
be able to husband their meagre income.
Bitterly opposed as the eight sisters had been
both to living together and leaving Walworth,
my father had overcome them by the sheer
power of his torrential eloquence and personality.
Surrounded by strangers, as he had
irresistibly reminded them, most of whom
were unacquainted with the English language,
fifteen miles from a railway station and three
and a half from the nearest village, they would
have neither the occasion nor the opportunity
to dissipate their substance in convivial extravagance,
while the precipitous roads, by
which alone the house that he had chosen for
them could be approached, would give them an
appetite for the extremely simple fare which
would be all that their means would allow
them to purchase. To Wales they had gone,
therefore, and though he continued to receive
letters from them, couched in terms of the
basest ingratitude, he neither replied to these
nor permitted them to modify his kindly
consideration for my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor had he been less adequate in dealing
with the circumstances that had arisen, a few
months later, in connection with the demises
of Mrs. Emily Smith and the aunt that had
stood with my mother’s mother at the foot
of the stairs. Both these ladies, who had been
living on Post Office annuities, had unhappily
died after sharing a sausage, strongly suspected,
though never actually proved, of harbouring
the bacillus of botulism. Thanks to my father’s
efforts, however, seconded by Mr. Balfour
Whey, the firm by whom the sausage had been
manufactured consented without prejudice to
pay a sum of money sufficient to provide for
the ladies’ interment. I have said sufficient,
but after my father had reimbursed himself
and paid the expenses of Mr. Whey, he was
once more faced, as in the case of my grandparents,
with an acute necessity for economy.
Burying them in a double coffin, however, of
his own design—a design for which he afterwards
obtained the patent—he succeeded not
only in keeping the undertaker’s bill within the
balance at his disposal but in providing a
surplus with which he afterwards obtained a
small iron slab containing their names and
ages. Nor was that all, for with the pound
or two that was over he bought a third-class
ticket to Aberdeen, where he had obtained a
situation for Mrs. Emily Smith’s granddaughter
as housemaid in a home for Xtian workers.</p>

<p class='c014'>After every such exhibition of pristine vigour,
however, my father experienced an acute reaction,
and for many weeks would become a
martyr not only to neurasthenic indigestion,
but to digestive neurasthenia accompanied by
flatulence of the severest order. For months
on end, indeed, my mother would be obliged
to sit by his bedside in case he should wake up
and require abdominal kneading, and few were
the nights upon which she had not in addition
to go downstairs and make him some cocoa.
But he would never allow himself to be daunted.
His breakfast the next morning would be as
hearty as usual. And he was never deterred
by even the most obstinate inflation from the
performance of a moral or religious duty.
Despite his courage, however, he was leaning
on me with ever-increasing emphasis, and I am
proud to recall that, in what was so soon to
prove the heaviest ordeal of his life, I was
able to render him very material and indeed
essential assistance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such then was the position when I parted
with the Stools, after the evening meal that I
have just recorded. And it was rather with
their cries of thanks and gentle admiration
resounding through the chill November night
than with any sense of impending trouble that
I turned my footsteps towards home. Indeed,
as I buttoned up my overcoat and drew my
scarf over my mouth, I had every reason to
feel content both on my own account and my
father’s, whose health for some weeks had been
slowly improving. For not only had my
mother’s parents been safely interred and her
eight sisters satisfactorily disposed of, her two
aunts competently buried, and Emily Smith
junior despatched to Aberdeen, but my father,
as I have indicated, had finally established
himself as the senior sidesman of St. James-the-Least-of-All.</p>

<p class='c014'>Conferring the right of leading the other
sidesmen up the central aisle at the end of the
collection, this was the more gratifying since
my father had only obtained it as the result
of a prolonged and determined struggle, in
which his chief opponent had been a retired
fishmonger, known as Alexander Carkeek. A
northern Caledonian of the most offensive type,
this gentleman, as he liked to consider himself,
was now a sleeping partner in the firm of
Carkeek and Carkeek, fishmongers and poulterers
in the Kennington Road, and had long
been suspected, both by my father and myself,
of a secret addiction to alcohol. Of middle
height—he was perhaps taller than my father
by an inch and three-quarters or two inches—his
abdominal circumference was equally extensive
and his bullet-shaped face even more
highly coloured. Unlike my father, however,
he had signally failed in retaining the bulk
of his hair, and even his two sons, Corkran and
Cosmo, were showing signs of becoming bald.
Sidesmen like their father, they were only less
aggressive, and during the long contest for
supremacy, they had seized every opportunity
of detaining or distracting my father while
their own got into position at the head of the
line. Indeed on one occasion, when my father
had paused for a moment to adjust a door-handle
half-way up the aisle, they had deliberately
encouraged their father to push himself
in front and thereby head the procession.
Naturally resenting this, my father had immediately
plunged forward, with the painful
result that the two of them had become wedged
and had been unable, owing to their respective
girths, either to advance or retreat. Needless
to say, in the struggle that ensued, my father
had been the first to break away and had
arrived at the chancel half an abdomen ahead
of his pertinacious rival.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Alexander Carkeek and his two sons</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Ultimately, as I have said, however, thanks
to repeated protests and an impassioned interview
with the vicar, my father had definitely
secured for himself the right of precedence,
though the Carkeeks still remained sidesmen.
Nor was that all. For it was now generally
known that the vicar’s churchwarden was about
to retire, and there could be little doubt, as my
father had several times observed to me, as
to the probable successor to this great position.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was with a comparatively light heart
therefore that I opened the front door, hung
up my hat and coat and folded my scarf, and
entered the parlour ready to describe to my
father the events that had occupied my evening;
and my distress can be imagined when I
at once perceived him to be in a state of the
acutest physical congestion. Facially suffused
to an alarming extent, the hairs of his moustache
were visibly projecting, and I naturally
assumed at first that he must have become the
subject of an exceptional degree of intestinal
discomfort. On closer inspection, however, I
observed that this could scarcely be the case
since his waistcoat buttons were still fastened,
and for a brief second I had a fearful apprehension
that he was annoyed with myself.
He did in fact ask me rather abruptly the
reason for my absence from the evening meal.
But his expression lightened a little when I
told him where I had been and of the services
rendered by me to Ezekiel Stool.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it’s a good family,” he said, “a very
good family, and there’s money in it as well
as religion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next moment, however, his face had
resumed its congestion, and as I leaned back
while my mother unlaced my boots, it became
increasingly evident to me that I was in the
presence of a spiritual crisis of the gravest
kind. Nay, even then, I remember, I had a
sudden presentiment that here was a situation
of no common significance, and I signalled to
my mother to be as rapid as possible in bringing
me my slippers and leaving us alone. Then I
took a deep breath and, leaning forward a
little, gently touched my father’s knee.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can I not help you?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father stared at me. For perhaps a
minute his lips moved convulsively. Then in
a strangled voice he uttered a single word,
followed a little later by fourteen other
words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Carkeek,” he said. “It’s that fellow Carkeek.
He’s been and presented the church
with a lectern.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I was utterly dumbfounded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A lectern?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father nodded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Made of brass,” he said, “in the image of a
bird.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of a bird?” I cried. “What sort of bird?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of an eagle,” said my father, “looking
towards the left.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Towards the left?” I said. “But where’s
it to stand?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“At the top of the aisle,” said my father,
“just below the chancel steps.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, dear father,” I cried, “we already
have a lectern,” and indeed this was literally
the case, since the cavity or enclosure adjoining
the choir seats, from which the vicar or his
curate read the service, was also provided with
a separate book-rest for the purpose of delivering
the lessons.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” said my father, “but that
wouldn’t deter Carkeek.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely,” I cried, “the vicar hasn’t
accepted it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He has not only accepted it,” said my father,
“but the thing’s in position.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In position,” I said, “and looking to the
left?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father nodded again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just west of south,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But good heavens,” I cried, “I say it in
all reverence, then it must be staring right
into our pew.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So it is,” said my father, “and not only
that, the brazen hell-bird’s protruding its
tongue.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The room darkened a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But not intentionally?” I asked. “You
don’t mean to say that it’s protruding its tongue
intentionally?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father gulped once or twice. Then he
bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I do,” he said, “and I say it deliberately.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he rose to his feet and stood looking
down at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And that’s not the worst,” he said, “not by
a long way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not the worst?” I cried. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father swayed a little, but managed to
recover himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I mean this,” he said. “I mean that
Alexander Carkeek is trying to get himself
made churchwarden.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I was stunned. My father sat
heavily down again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But good God,” I cried, “that amounts to
simony.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know,” said my father. “That’s what
I’ve told Carkeek.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you’ve seen him?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father looked at me grimly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve not only seen him,” he answered,
“but I’ve told him what I’ve thought of him.
And I’ve explicitly informed him that if he’s
made a churchwarden, I shall take proceedings
against him in the ecclesiastical courts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father leaned back closing his eyes, and I
had never admired him more, perhaps, than at
that moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the vicar,” I said. “Have you spoken
to the vicar?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was obliged to warn him,” said my father,
“in identical terms.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You could do no less,” I said. “But what
about the bird itself?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I regret to say,” said my father, “that he
professed to admire it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at him aghast.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Professed to admire it?” I gasped. “The
vicar that we have supported all these years?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father covered his eyes for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Even so,” he said. “As I had to point out
to him, I was seriously shaken.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely you protested,” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For seventy-five minutes,” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But couldn’t he perceive,” I said, “that it
was a direct insult to us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father moved his hand a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He claimed that it was not so. He said
that the majority of these birds looked towards
the left.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But not with their tongues out,” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He seemed to think so. He said it was
symbolic of inward joy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But good heavens,” I said, “I repeat it
with all reverence, does he expect us to worship
under conditions like that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sorry to say,” said my father, “that
he had appeared to contemplate it prior to my
insistence on its immediate removal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart gave a great leap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then it’s being taken down?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>But my father stared at me with bulging eyes.
My heart fell back again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s why I’m
preparing my denunciation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a solemn moment. It was perhaps the
solemnest moment that either of us had been
called upon to experience, and even as I spoke,
I felt that we were drawing towards the threshold
of one of the greatest issues of our terrestrial
life.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then he refused?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me be quite fair,” said my father.
“He rather temporized than actually refused.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not help smiling a little sardonically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The distinction is a fine one,” I said. “I
suppose he adduced some grounds?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father breathed heavily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He was insolent enough to remind me,” he
said, “that it was eight o’clock on Saturday
evening and that the bird in question, which
had only just been set up, weighed approximately
a quarter of a ton. He also suggested
that the congregation ought to have an opportunity
of inspecting it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The congregation?” I cried. “But what
has the congregation to do with it? It’s not
putting its tongue out at the congregation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father inclined his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Precisely what I told him,” he said, “but
he merely fell back upon his previous argument,
that the exposure of the tongue, if indeed it
were a tongue, was merely significant of good
tidings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see,” I said. “So you gave him an
ultimatum?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was compelled to,” said my father.
“There was no other course. Either it must
be removed, I told him, before to-morrow
morning or I should publicly denounce it during
morning service.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what did he say?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father made a contemptuous gesture.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you know what he is,” he replied, “a
weed before the rind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mean a reed,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did I say?” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You said a weed,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I said a weed?” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A weed before the wind,” I said. “I mean
the rind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The rind?” said my father. “But that’s
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. But that’s what you said,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A weed before the rind?” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, a transposition,” I explained, “of the
initial consonants.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A transposition?” enquired my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, an error in enunciation,” I said, “such
as frequently takes place under emotional
stress.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, I don’t understand,” said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You meant a reed before the wind,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, of course,” said my father. “That’s
what I said.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, you said a weed,” I said, “a weed
before the rind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how can a weed be before the rind?”
said my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you didn’t mean that,” I said. “You
meant a reed before the wind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, that’s what he is,” said my father.
“That’s just what I say. That’s why he
implored me not to make a denunciation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But of course you will,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father nodded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Immediately after the collection,” said my
father, “and before the blessing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at the clock. It was a quarter past
ten. In an hour and three-quarters the sabbath
would be upon us. There was not much time.
I glanced at my father anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How far have you got?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“About half-way,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he rose to his feet again and crossed to
the harmonium.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ring for the cocoa,” he said. I sprang to
the bell. But just as I reached it my mother
entered, bearing two cups of the sustaining
fluid. Signalling to her to withdraw, he lifted
one of the cups and drained its contents at a
single gulp.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now, listen,” he said, and in a low but
rising voice, he began a denunciation that I
shall never forget.</p>

<p class='c014'>Impeccable in logic, succinct in argument,
perfect in phrasing and faultlessly delivered, I
have never, I think, listened to so moving an
utterance as the initial moiety of my father’s
denunciation. Beginning, as I have said, in a
low voice, yet one that was crystal clear in its
penetrating capacity, for the first five minutes
or so my father refused to allow himself the
adventitious aid of a single gesture. It was the
gathering of the storm, as it were, the marshalling
of the hosts of heaven, composed but
relentless, above the brazen image. Then he
paused for a moment, indicating the aspidistra
that stood upon a tripod in the corner of the
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now, say that’s the bird,” he said, and
suddenly like a flash of lightning, his right
index finger was quivering upon the air. Involuntarily
I leapt round and stared at the
aspidistra, and then like the deafening downburst
of a tornado, my father expanded his
chest, threw back his head, and opened the full
floodgates of his passion. Pallid and cowering,
I crept behind the armchair, while syllable after
syllable rent the night, and the delirious harmonium
leapt and crashed down again beneath
the palpitant thunder of his blows. Then
almost as suddenly he stopped.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s as far as I’ve got,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I crept from my shelter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is there to be much more?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“About five minutes’ calm,” he said, “and
then the final, culminating climax.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He wiped his forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve got it roughed out,” he said, “if
you’d like to hear it before it’s rounded
off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I signified my assent, and he proceeded. But
indeed it already seemed to me to be practically
flawless, while the ultimate crescendo, prepared
as I had believed myself, left me literally
prostrate and fighting for breath. My father,
on the other hand, although he was perspiring
freely, seemed to have become endowed with a
new lease of life, and was able single-handed to
replace the harmonium which had fallen upon
its face during his closing sentence. Then there
came a low knock on the parlour window. It
was nearly eleven; we stared at each other
startled; and it was with considerable relief
that we perceived the new-comer to be no
more important than Simeon Whey. Yet his
errand was a kind one, although it was a considerable
time before he was sufficiently master
of himself to explain his presence, while we had
already foreseen and prepared for the tidings
that had brought the admirable youth to our
window.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hearing from his father, whom my father had
already consulted, of the very great trouble with
which we were threatened, he had put on his
hat and coat, wrapped his scarf round his neck,
and immediately hurried to St. James-the-Least-of-All.
There, with infinite cunning and
hardly less devotion, he had managed to conceal
himself behind a tombstone, where he had
awaited for nearly an hour and a half the
arrival of workmen to remove the lectern.
None had come, however, and somewhere about
half-past ten, he had reluctantly abandoned his
vigil and, faint with hunger, hurried to Angela
Gardens to apprise us of its result.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kck,” he said, when we had given him a
biscuit, “I’m afraid it’ll be a case of denunciation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father nodded grimly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So I had anticipated,” he said. “In fact
I had just been denouncing when you knocked
at the window.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kck,” said Simeon—now a theological
student—“I should like to have heard you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father glanced at me, and I inclined my
head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll do it again,” he said, and he returned
to the harmonium.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was he less powerful than on the first
occasion, and I shall never forget his effect on
Simeon Whey. Beginning as before in a low
voice, yet one that was crystal clear in its
penetrative capacity, for the first five minutes
or so he refused to allow himself the adventitious
aid of a single gesture. It was the
gathering of the storm, as it were, the marshalling
of the hosts of heaven, composed but
relentless, above the brazen image. Then he
paused for a moment, again indicating the
aspidistra that stood upon a tripod in the
corner of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now, say that’s the bird,” he said, and
suddenly, like a flash of lightning, his right
index finger was quivering upon the air. Involuntarily
Simeon leapt round and stared at
the aspidistra, and then like the deafening
downburst of a tornado, my father expanded
his chest, threw back his head, and opened the
full floodgates of his passion. Pallid and cowering,
Simeon crept behind the armchair while
syllable after syllable rent the night, and the
delirious harmonium leapt and crashed down
again beneath the palpitant thunder of my
father’s blows. Then for five minutes there
was a comparative calm, while Simeon Whey
crept from his shelter, until the ultimate crescendo
stretched him helpless on the carpet, blue
in the face, and fighting for his breath. Then
he staggered to his feet and sank into the armchair,
while my father once more picked up
the harmonium.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, kck,” he said, “kck.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was all that the poor youth was able to
utter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Breakfast finds us calm but grave. My mother is allowed to
accompany us to church. My father’s clothing and
general demeanour. Remark of Simeon Whey on my
father’s hat. First impressions of the new lectern.
Unmistakable evidences of guilt. The vicar’s feeble
apologia. A devilish device and its disastrous results.
I race with Corkran for half-a-crown. My poor father
is three times dropped.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Impeccable</span> in logic, as I have already said,
succinct in argument, and perfect in phrasing,
it is with the profoundest regret that I have been
obliged to omit from these pages the actual
words of my father’s denunciation; and I
should like to make it quite clear that for the
inevitable disappointment my publishers alone
must bear the blame. Bitterly as I have
protested, however, they have replied to every
argument with sordid references to the cost
of production, and this volume has in consequence
been rushed through the press deprived
of my poor father’s terrible indictment.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Nor
is this the less deplorable because at the last
moment my father himself was prohibited
from uttering it, owing to an intervention of
Providence as little to have been expected as
it has always appeared to me inexplicable.
Indeed, had we foreseen it, I doubt if either
my father or myself would have been able to
retain his sanity, and we should certainly not
have met, as we did the next morning, in a
comparatively cheerful frame of mind.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f8'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is my full intention, however, to pursue this matter
further, and any reader desirous of signing an appeal should
instantly communicate with me at Wilhelmina, Nassington
Park Gardens, Hornsey.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Yet this was the case, and although, as each
of us remarked, the expression of the other
was unwontedly grave, it was a relief to us
both to learn that neither of us had spent a bad,
or even indifferent, night. Considering the
circumstances, indeed, we had slept remarkably
well, and in view of the tremendous task that
now certainly awaited us, each of us was scrupulous
to fortify his person with as large and
nourishing a meal as possible. As we sang
the morning hymn, too, I was glad to perceive
that my father’s voice was in exceptional condition,
while the sunshine and soft air augured
well for a particularly large congregation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The more, the better,” said my father,
and he even went so far as to permit the attendance
of my mother, thereby excusing her from
her usual task of preparing our midday
meal or dinner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll have something cold,” he said,
“middle day, and she shall give us a good hot
meal after evening service.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With myself on his right, then, and my
mother on his left, we left the house at 10.45,
and I have never, I think, seen my father so
meticulously dressed as on this stern but
necessary occasion. Wearing his longest frock-coat,
a double-breasted gentian waistcoat, faultlessly
creased trousers, and the glossiest of
brown boots, his collar was encircled with a
cream-coloured velvet tie, held in position
by a single Cape garnet. By a happy circumstance,
too, his bowler hat had only been purchased
the week before; and indeed, as Simeon
whispered to me, it might rather have been
that of some French aristocrat mounting the
tumbril than of a Xtian sidesman of the United
Kingdom on his way to denounce a lectern. Nor
did he hesitate to lift it when we met Mr. and
Mrs. Carkeek, accompanied by Cosmo and
Corkran, although I have seen nothing more
distant than the inclination of the head with
which he signified consciousness of their presence.
As Simeon said to me, “Your father may be a
Xtian, but he never forgets that he’s a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We were now on the brink, however, of the
church porch—a couple of steps and the effigy
would be in sight—and deeply as we had
impressed upon each other the necessity for
self-command, I could not help staggering a
little and leaning against Simeon. My father
staggered too, leaning against Mr. Balfour
Whey, while my mother staggered against Mrs.
Meatson, the obliging wife of Mr. Meatson, the
editor of the parish magazine. Then with
a supreme effort we recovered our equilibria,
and in the next moment—albeit at a distance—we
were facing an image that, for malignant
effrontery, was surely unparalleled in Church
history.</p>

<p class='c014'>I say facing, for although its actual countenance
was turned, as I have said, towards the
left, its malevolent bosom as well as its right
eye were directly focussed upon our persons.
Nor can I trust myself, even now, to describe
its effect upon us as we moved up the aisle,
although every detail of its repulsive appearance
was indelibly graved upon my memory.
Suffice it to say, therefore, that it gave the general
impression of a vulture rather than an eagle;
that it appeared to have robbed an arsenal
of a medium-sized cannon-ball, upon which
it now stood poised on the summit of a mast;
and that its outspread wings had been blasphemously
converted into a support for the
Holy Scriptures. Nor was that all, for at each
corner of the pedestal, in which the mast had
been embedded, was an additional claw with
projecting talons of undisguised ferocity—the
total effect from the bottom of the aisle being
that of a six-clawed monster about to expectorate.</p>

<p class='c014'>Repellent as was its appearance, however,
even at a distance, it was not until we drew
nearer to it up the central aisle that I suddenly
became aware in it of a quite unforeseen and
infinitely sinister significance. For now, as
we approached our pew, which was the front one
on the right, it was perfectly clear that its eyes
had been so fashioned as to be capable of regarding
us, either separately or in unison, with
an almost unbelievable degree of venom. But
they could do more, for what was my horror,
just as we were about to turn into our pew, to perceive
that my father, whose colour had visibly
deepened, was still holding on towards the chancel.
Nay, to be exact, he was still holding on
towards the very image that he had come to
condemn, with his two eyes fixed and slowly
converging upon the baleful eyeball of the bird
itself. For a moment I stood spellbound.
What was he about to do? And then, as the
pew rocked beneath my feet, I suddenly realized
that my poor father had been foully and deliberately
hypnotized.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a critical instant. Another couple
of steps, and one of two things must inevitably
have happened. He would either have dashed
his forehead against the bird’s bosom, or his
abdomen would have collided with the mast.
Nor was the danger less real because it was as
yet unperceived either by my mother or the
rest of the congregation. With an enormous
effort, however, I succeeded in rallying myself
and seizing and compressing my father’s right
elbow, steering him half-conscious into his
usual place, where he immediately fell forward
upon his knees. Then I bent down. “It
was the bird’s eye,” I said. “Whatever you
do, avoid the bird’s eye,” and ample was my
reward in the immensely powerful squeeze
which was the only thanks he was able to bestow.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the danger was not over, for, now that
we were in our pew, we were being permanently
impinged upon by the bird’s full visage, and I
saw at once that we should be taxed to the
uttermost to sustain its gaze until the end of
the service. Regarded from this aspect, however,
in which its competing tongue masked the
malignity of its eyes, its expression was less
menacing than insolent, albeit to an almost
intolerable extent. And it was obviously in
the exposed eye, solitary and unchallenged,
with which it had followed us up the aisle,
that its concentrated malice had found the
weapon most effective for its purpose. Temporarily
released, therefore, from the acutest
personal anxiety, I was at last in a position to
observe my fellow-worshippers, and I would
that I could record even some semblance of
resentment at the loathsome object with which
they had been confronted. Upon no face,
however, could I see anything inscribed beyond
an unintelligent curiosity, while upon many
I could not fail to observe an even more lamentable
admiration.</p>

<p class='c014'>Indeed I could hear actual whispers, indicative
of approval, such as “Did you ever, now?”
or “Isn’t it handsome?” while some put such
queries to one another as, “What do you suppose
it cost?” “Whoever could have paid for it?”
and “Hasn’t it got a polish?” Nor have I
seen anything, I think, quite so nauseating to
a sensitive Xtian stomach as the scarcely-concealed
triumph so smugly discernible upon
the faces of the four Carkeeks. My only reassurance,
in fact, lay in the reflection that my
father’s denunciation had yet to come; that
in so large an assembly there must surely be
one or two to whom the bird’s true character
must have been obvious; and that the vicar
and his curate, who were now nervously entering,
had not finally committed themselves.
Then the organ ceased playing, the vicar, who
was plucking at his surplice, hastily glanced
at my father, and the curate, whom I had
never seen paler, tremblingly embarked upon
the service.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pale as was the curate, however, and staccato
as was his utterance, he was the very embodiment
of self-confidence compared with the vicar
when the latter first approached the lectern
under the steadfast gaze of my dear father;
and I have seldom seen the consciousness of
guilt take such visible toll of an alleged Xtian
clergyman as when this weak prelate staggered
from his corner and clung tottering to Carkeek’s
eagle. Nor had I perceived until then—or
not so fully—the profound wisdom that had
been my father’s in concealing from these men
the exact moment at which he intended to make
his protest. For they were thus proceeding
in the devastating knowledge that at any
syllable they might be cut short, and publicly
arraigned before the whole congregation for
their base act of betrayal.</p>

<p class='c014'>In spite of my anxiety, therefore, I could
scarcely suppress a smile, and I was glad to
observe, as I glanced at my father, that he was
once more in complete command both of himself
and the situation. Indeed I had never heard
him in such stupendous voice as during the hymn
that preceded the sermon, and it was obvious
that the vicar conceived this to be the prelude
to the actual deliverance of the indictment.
It was at any rate some moments before he was
able to speak, and I have never, I think, heard
a more pitiable noise than the quavering tones
in which he uttered the words of Jeremiah,
“Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f9'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah xii. 9.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Spoken by the prophet, he said, under conditions
of considerable stress—and who had
known more stress than the prophet Jeremiah?—it
might also be rendered, as the margin so
beautifully reminded us, as a bird having
talons. Mine heritage is unto me as a bird
having talons—here he paused for a moment,
avoiding my father’s eye—or might he not say,
perhaps, using the plural, <i>our</i> heritage is a bird
having talons? For in this great gift, this
unique gift, that few of us could have failed,
he thought, to have noticed, we were all participators,
even the most degraded of us, thanks
to the generosity of Mr. Carkeek. Yes, it was
indeed <i>our</i> heritage, <i>ours</i>, a speckled bird, a
bird having talons. And who could say that
the care-stricken prophet had not foreseen
this beautiful lectern?</p>

<p class='c014'>For it was a beautiful lectern—few, he thought,
could deny this—this speckled bird, this bird
having talons. And yet it might well be that,
owing to its very unexpectedness, it should give
rise to differing opinions. Nay, he would go
further. He would hope that it might, for
they were all there, he trowed, in a double
capacity—as human beings, overflowing with
gratitude, but also as trustees for the church’s
furniture.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yes, they were trustees. They must never
forget that. That was a distinction that he
would have them remember. They were not
only human beings, but they were churchmen
and trustees—church-beings, trustees and
human men—yea, and women also, churchees
and trust-men; furniture-women, church-trusts
and humanees. They were all those things,
and they would remember the old saying, so
many men, so many opinions. Thus it might
be argued—and very reasonably argued—that
the present reading-desk was sufficient, and that
the very magnificence of this noble bird might
a little detract from its holy purpose. As for
that, the congregation must judge. He would
welcome the opinion of each one of them.
There was not one of them whose opinion he
would not welcome, even the lowliest and most
sinful. For though our heritage had come
unto us as a speckled bird, as a bird having
talons, it did not necessarily follow that it was
our Xtian duty to take it up and enter into it.
Many great men, as they were doubtless aware,
had given up heritages of considerable value,
and who should say that they had not been
actuated by the highest and most holy considerations?
But others like Esau had lived to regret
it. It was a matter for the congregation to
decide, united though they would be in their
undying appreciation of the splendid munificence
of Mr. Carkeek. A speckled bird,
a bird having talons—let them not lightly
discard their heritage. But let them not, on
the other hand, too lightly accept it as a bird
of no moment. Then, with obvious relief,
and indeed a certain amount of complacence,
he hurriedly backed down the pulpit steps,
just as the curate, leaping to his feet, gave
out the number of the closing hymn.</p>

<p class='c014'>But my father was not perturbed. Throughout
the whole service, indeed, he had sat there
expressionless as a sphinx, but none the less
terrible, because his unwinking eyes had given
no hint of their ultimate purpose. Then he
rose to his feet, carrying his offertory plate,
and it was only in the very deliberateness with
which he did so that the most discerning might
have gathered a hint, perhaps, of the stupendous
judgment about to fall from him. Nor did
he allow the task, which was now so imminent,
to interfere with his usual custom of joining
in the hymn to his uttermost capacity as he
moved from pew to pew collecting the offertory.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the great moment was now close at hand,
and I could not forbear turning for a moment
in my place and glancing down the aisle at the
procession of sidesmen, already formed and waiting
my father’s signal. For from now onwards
even I myself was a little uncertain of my father’s
intentions, although I did not apprehend that
he would begin his denunciation before the last
of the sidesmen had yielded up his plate. Then
I glanced at the vicar, who had come to the
chancel steps; at the curate, who was plucking
at his stole; and finally at the bird, with its
brazen eye fixed as before on my approaching
father. For the hymn had come to an end now
and the procession was in motion, with my father
in the van carrying his plate, followed by
Alexander Carkeek, Mr. Balfour Whey, Mr.
Meatson, Cosmo and Corkran. Slowly they
proceeded, with Mr. Carkeek, as usual, chafing
at the necessity of having to march second,
but obviously intoxicated with pride and self-satisfaction
as the people in the pews craned
their heads to look at him. So disgusting
indeed did I find the spectacle that I was obliged
for some seconds to close my eyes, and it was
during this brief interval that there happened
the awful thing that was finally to shatter my
father’s health. For when I opened them
again, pale and petrified, it was once more to
behold my father caught and transfixed and
stertorously advancing into the same ingenious
and devilish trap.</p>

<p class='c014'>But now it was too late, though I gave a
great cry, and yet that cry, perhaps, may
have modified the disaster. For at the last
instant, as though he had half-regained consciousness,
my father swerved a little to the right,
albeit only to stumble and fall at full length
over the south-west talons of the pedestal.
And yet even then the sidesman in him remained
uppermost. For though a half-crown had been
jerked from his plate, he never let this go until
he had safely grounded it at the very feet of
the vicar. Nay, he rose higher. For observing
that the half-crown was hurrying towards a
grating at the end of the transept, and perceiving
that Corkran Carkeek, obeying his
family’s instinct, had suddenly leapt forward
and was hastening after it, he bade me try and
secure it before the young Caledonian had
succeeded in capturing it for his own box.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But your poor self?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never mind me,” he said, “or he’ll get his
foot on that half-crown.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And it was then, and only then, that he yielded
to Nature with shriek after shriek of unutterable
pain.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was an astounding moment. For there
were thus two spectacles competing for the
attention of the congregation, most of whom
had now risen and were standing on their seats
in the natural desire to observe events. For
in the first place there was my father, writhing
on his abdomen at the foot of the lectern, and
in the second there were Corkran and myself
engaged in the bitterest of races to save and
recapture the half-crown. Nor did I win.
For though I managed to overtake him, he got
his boot upon it at the last moment, just as I
had stooped and was about to lift it up at the
very brink of the grating. Choking as I was,
however, and in spite of his exceptional height,
I was able to look him full in the collar and
assure him that from that moment I should
cease to number him amongst even the most
distant of my acquaintances. Then, dumb
with wrath and blinded with tears, I managed
to swing round upon my heels just as the remaining
sidesmen, assisted by the vicar and curate,
succeeded in raising my poor father.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the ordeal was not over. Nay, it had
hardly begun. For not only did they drop
him in the south transept, but they dropped
him a second time in the side aisle, and again
upon the threshold of the vestry. Whether
this was intentional will never be known, or
not until that Day when all shall be made clear.
But I cannot help mentioning that the Carkeeks
were among the bearers, and that I had never
seen the curate looking so cheerful.</p>

comments. A quiet church and obliging clergy. Surprising
character-growth of Ezekiel. A distasteful proposition
generously put forward. Disgusting behaviour
of a show-room manager.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Such</span> then was the incident that not only, as
I have said, finally destroyed my father’s
health, but was also destined, after several
weeks of the profoundest physical inconvenience,
and almost as many months of the acutest
legal anxiety, to deprive him (and ultimately
myself) of the greater portion of his savings.
For it was obvious from the outset that the
matter had to be challenged—and indeed we
had so pledged ourselves before the ambulance
bore him from the vestry—at whatever cost to
ourselves and our friends, and before as many
tribunals as might prove necessary; and it has
often seemed to me that it was only this sacred
obligation that preserved my father from
immediate extinction. For not only was it
discovered by the three doctors, who were
immediately summoned to attend upon him, that
his right knee was displaying evidences of
incipient synovitis, but the three falls, to which
he had been subjected between the lectern and
the vestry, had resulted in extremely severe
contusions of both his larger gluteal muscles.</p>

<p class='c014'>The problem before the physicians was thus
an exceptionally difficult one. For while the
condition of his knee demanded that he should
lie upon his back, that of his gluteal muscles
was even more imperative in demanding a
position precisely opposed to this. After a
considerable argument, therefore, it was finally
decided that for the first week or ten days
the position to be assumed should be a face-downwards
one, with a protective cage over the
contused muscles. By this means any painful
pressure that might have been exerted by the
bedclothes was avoided—an additional protection
being afforded by two discs of lint, previously
spread with a cooling ointment. For the
purposes of nourishment, which was to be
ample and sustaining, my father was then to be
drawn towards the end of the bed, his head
being allowed to project to a sufficient distance
to permit of nutriment being inserted from
below. Owing to his weight, this, of course,
necessitated the erection of a pulley with straps
passing under his arm-pits, a return pulley with
straps passing round his ankles coming into play
at the end of each meal. Even with such
assistance, however, my poor father’s plight
remained an exceedingly deplorable one; and
it is scarcely to be wondered at that, from time
to time, he betrayed a marked irritability.</p>

<p class='c014'>Prostrate as he was, however, and already
conscious that his career as a sidesman was
definitely over, he flung himself almost immediately,
and with all the energy left to
him, into the necessary preliminaries of the
approaching litigation. Day after day, even
while still lying on his abdomen, he held prolonged
interviews with Mr. Balfour Whey, who
most considerately lay beneath my father’s bed,
parallel with the sufferer and looking up into
his face. Whether, in the world’s history, an
action of such importance—for it was fully
reported in most of the daily newspapers—was
ever arranged in similar circumstances I do not
know, although I doubt it. But I have certainly
never seen a spectacle more solemn and
pathetic than that of these two earnest and
horizontal men vertically discussing, across the
end of the bedstead, the possible methods of
legal procedure.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was either to blame for the iniquitous
judgments, into the details of which I do not
propose to enter, but which had the effect, as I
have already stated, of seriously impoverishing
my poor father. For from the outset Mr.
Balfour Whey, although sharing to the full in
my father’s indignation, was explicit as to the
difficulty that would certainly accrue in translating
this into a legal victory. Indeed the only
vehicle under which proceedings could possibly
be instituted was the original and extremely
crude Employers’ Liability Act,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and this upon
the doubtful assumption of the applicability of
Sub-section (I) of Section I, and subject to the
further acceptance of the Carkeek lectern as a
portion of the plant of St. James-the-Least-of-All.
Under this earlier Act, too, the status of
the vicar as employer and that of his sidesmen
as employés was far less substantiable in law
that it would have been under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act; and deeply as I have
always regretted, on general grounds, the inclusion
of this latter measure in our legal
machinery, I have equally deplored that it was
not then available to assist my poor father in
his heroic crusade.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f10'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>43 and 44 Vic. cap 42 (1880).</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>From the beginning, therefore, it was an
unequal contest, with the dice of evasion loaded
against my father, and all the forces of idolatry,
spite, and ambition arrayed to defeat the
course of justice. Thus, despite the arguments—and
I have never listened to longer or more
powerful ones—of the celebrated counsel that
my father employed; despite the photographs—and
I have never seen any more heart-rending—of
the contused areas of my father’s person;
and despite the irrepressible applause from
Simeon and myself that greeted his every reply
in the witness-box, the case was not only
decided against him with costs, on a series of
the most palpable legal quibbles, but an appeal
to a higher court met with a similarly scandalous
and financially devastating result. Obviously
primed, too, by the Carkeeks—although our
detectives were unable to prove this—the verdict
in each case became the subject of a malicious
article in the <i>Camberwell Observer</i>, my father
once more having to bear the total costs of the
prosecutions that immediately ensued.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor did a printed appeal to the congregation
of St. James-the-Least-of-All bring my poor
father more than eight shillings, although the
cost of its printing and subsequent postage had
amounted to no less than three pounds. Moreover—and
even now the pen shakes in my
hand as I force it to write the shameful words—not
only was the lectern retained in the church
(where it may probably be seen at this moment),
but within less than a year Cosmo and Corkran
Carkeek were the sons of the vicar’s churchwarden.
It was perhaps the bitterest stab of
the whole squalid conspiracy. But my father
was then too enfeebled for active resistance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let it be enough,” he wrote to Alexander
Carkeek, “until at a Greater Bar you shall stand
condemned, that you know, and I know, and
so does your vicar, that you have committed
simony in your heart.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So ended an episode with which I have dealt
thus fully—at what a cost can well be imagined—partly
because, as I have said, the contemporary
newspaper accounts of it were either misleading
or deliberately spiteful, but chiefly because it
was the means adopted by Providence of uniting
us still more closely with the Stools. That this
was an end possible of achievement otherwise,
I have never disguised my private opinion.
But since it was to lead to my own ultimate
matrimony, I have always considered it best
to suspend judgment; and I cannot but feel
convinced that my readers will share the relief
with which I now begin to approach this distant
event.</p>

<p class='c014'>For it was still distant. Let there be no
mistake about that. And in the particular
form in which it was about to be adumbrated,
I ought not to conceal, perhaps, that for several
years I found it extremely distasteful. Nevertheless
it came about, and even when Ezekiel
first suggested it, deeply repugnant though the
idea seemed to me, I could not help recognizing
and suitably acknowledging the generosity with
which it had been put forward.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Augustus,” he said, “each of my
sisters will receive an equal portion of my
father’s estate, and if it would be any help to
you, I should be only too glad to give you
one of them in marriage.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was on the Sunday evening, I remember,
the sixth after we had lost our action against
the <i>Camberwell Observer</i>, and the seventeenth
after my father had been mulcted in costs by
the infamous judgment of the Court of Appeal—upon
which we had decided, after careful
investigation, to transfer our worship to St.
Nicholas, Newington Butts. A quiet edifice,
devoid of a lectern, yet within a few yards of
the tram-lines, it had seemed to us both,
although it had various drawbacks, as suitable
a receptacle as we should be likely to find for
the very modified degree of worship of which
my father now remained capable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“After what has happened,” he said, “it
is of course a subject in which I can scarcely
be expected to take much further interest.
But the church appears clean and its clergy
seem obliging, if not particularly intelligent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Making it quite clear, therefore, that he would
be entirely unable to accept any position of
responsibility, and that his attendances, even as
an ordinary worshipper, would almost certainly
be precarious, my father had added his name to
its list of clients, to which I had been very
happy to subscribe my own. This we had done
verbally, at the close of the morning service,
to the obvious satisfaction of the vicar and his
curate, Ezekiel having been absent, as his
sisters had informed me, owing to a mild
attack of gastro-enteritis. At the evening service,
however, he was present as usual, and it
was upon our way home together after its
close that I told him of the decision to which
my father and I had come, and of which we had
already apprised the clergy. Transported with
delight, he shook me by the hand, the hairs
upon his face sparkling with happy tears, and
I shall never forget the emotion with which he
expressed his hope that this would complete the
intimacy between us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Drawn together,” he said, “in the <i>A.D.S.U.</i>
and by your memorable salvation of me on the
fifth of November, and further united in the
misfortunes that have befallen the fathers of
us both, surely this must be the link that
shall finally unite us in a firm and irrevocable
friendship.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Deeply moved, I was unable to reply for a
moment. But presently, in a response of some
duration, I contrived to signify my general
agreement with the aspirations that he had
enunciated. He then invited me to share a
second evening meal with himself, his mother
and his five sisters, and it was during the
progress of this that I first became aware of a
new development of his character. Hitherto,
as I have said, of an extremely gentle and even
yielding disposition, he had now assumed, with
a dignity and completeness that both surprised
and delighted me, not only the headship of the
table but the full direction of the household.
Thus when Faith ventured upon a remark that,
on a week-day, might have been considered
humorous, he at once reminded her that it was
the Sabbath and gently but firmly demanded
an apology; while a look from his eye was
sufficient to quell Hope who inadvertently
“hiccuped” during the pronouncement of grace.
I was glad to observe, too, that these facially
unattractive girls all remained seated until he
had indicated that they might rise, and that
together with their mother they instantly left
the room when he inclined his head toward
the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>So effective, indeed, was his assumption of his
father’s duties that I could not refrain from
congratulating him, and it was during the
conversation that naturally followed that he
supplied me with details of the family finances.
Thus I learned from him that, prior to his
admission to the Home of Rest in which he
was now detained, his father had been persuaded
by his legal advisers to retire from the
management of the Adult Gripe Water; and
that the right to manufacture this, together
with the existing plant, had then been sold to
a limited company. As the sole proprietor,
Mr. Abraham Stool had received a considerable
sum of money, half of this having been paid
to him in cash and the remainder in shares of
the new company. The cash had then been
invested, upon his solicitor’s advice, in colonial
and Government securities, and a will drawn
up of which Ezekiel was kind enough to give
me the exact particulars. Then he paused for
a moment, and it was then, leaning towards
me with the utmost affection, that he uttered
the words of which, as I have already recorded,
I could not but recognize the good feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so you see, dear Augustus, each of my
sisters will receive an equal portion of my
father’s estate, and if it would be any help to
you, I should be only too glad to give you one
of them in marriage.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Admirably meant, however, as was this offer,
and obviously one of considerable value, few
could have blamed me, I think, for the instinctive
shudder with which I was obliged at first to
postpone an answer. Nor was he one of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In fact I never supposed,” he said, “that
you could immediately bring yourself to accept.
And I fully appreciate that, had I been in your
position, my gesture of repulsion would have
been equally violent. But at the same time I
thought it might be useful to you to know that
they would be there to fall back upon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To fall back upon?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Colouring deeply, he held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was speaking metaphorically,” he said.
“I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Conceded,” I replied. “But it was an
unpleasant idea.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And an ill-chosen phrase,” he said. “All
that I meant was that they would be there
for you to select from.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean all of them?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>He signified his assent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Subject to the Great Reaper,” he said,
“I think that I can promise that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then for five minutes we sat in silence, and
then, extending my hand to him, I rose to
my feet.</p>

<p><i>Ezekiel Stool, drawn from a portrait once in the possession of the A.D.S.U.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Ezekiel,” I said, “I am not unobliged to
you, and although I could never view such a
marriage with enthusiasm, yet I can conceive
circumstances in which, as a last resort, it
might be my duty to consider it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Precisely,” he said, “and it is for such a
contingency that I shall be only too glad, as
I have said, to reserve them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we parted, Ezekiel, as he afterwards
told me, to the happy contemplation of our
closer friendship, and myself, as I walked home,
to the sombre consideration of the possibilities
with which I had been presented. I had
scarcely been so occupied, however, for ten
minutes when I suddenly became aware of the
odour of alcohol, and to my infinite horror
found myself being embraced by the show-room
manager from Paternoster Row.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, ShAugustus,” he said. “Fansheen
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Involuntarily I recoiled from him, but he
came after me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fansheen you,” he repeated. “Hahu?”</p>

<p class='c014'>And having kissed me, he sat down on the
pavement.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Person and character of Mr. Archibald Maidstone. Irreverent
attitude towards the firm’s publications. Would-be
laxity of two constables. Their tardy performance of
an obvious duty. Deplorable condition of my Sunday
trousers. Their effect on Miss Botterill and Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton. The arrival and influence of the Reverend
Eugene Cake. Mr. Maidstone is dismissed and I succeed
him. Complete discomfiture of his three elder children.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>I have</span> said that he sat down, and even had
that been all, it would have been a sufficiently
unpleasant encounter, although, as I had instantly
seen, it ought certainly to issue in my
own immediate commercial advancement. But
he did more, for so firmly did he grip my arm
that I was compelled to sit down beside him,
with what reluctance will be the better imagined
when I have briefly described his person and
character. By name Archibald Maidstone, he
was a tall, gaunt man with high cheek-bones
and a grey moustache, and in his earlier life he
had held some sort of position in the British
mercantile marine. An accident at sea, however,
had deprived him of one of his eyes as
well as of the two middle fingers of his left
hand, and for some time he had been the proprietor
of a small and unsuccessful marine store.
He had then become a commercial traveller for
a firm of grocers that had subsequently failed,
and had finally, at the age of forty-one, obtained
a minor position in the business of Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton.</p>

<p class='c017'>A married man with several children, he had
afterwards been appointed show-room manager,
and it was as his assistant, as I have already
said, that I had entered Mr. Lorton’s employment.
From the outset, however, although I
had endeavoured to conceal this, I had both
disliked and distrusted him, and in spite of
what I presumed to be a species of nautical
humour, I had found his attitude towards me
peculiarly offensive. I had never been accustomed,
for example, as I had been obliged to
point out to him, to be addressed as ‘young-feller-me-lad,’
or ‘the bosun’s mate,’ and I
had even been compelled to report him to
Mr. Lorton in order to secure more respectful
treatment. I had been deeply concerned, too,
to observe the levity with which, in the absence
of customers, he would handle and describe
the sacred publications of which it was his
privilege to be the salesman. ‘Bilge-water
for the Bairns,’ for instance, was a frequent
expression of his for our well-known series of
<i>Talks with the Infants</i>, and I had even heard
him refer to a parcel of <i>Claudie’s Temptations</i> as
“another half-hundredweight of the Prigs’ Paradise.”
Indeed, on one occasion, ignorant of the
presence of the author—the celebrated Non-conformist,
the Reverend Eugene Cake—he had
tossed me a window-copy of <i>Without are Dogs</i>,
saying that, if they were ‘wise bow-wows,’
they would stay there; and it was only after
a second interview with Mr. Chrysostom Lorton,
the tearful intervention of Mrs. Maidstone, and
a complete apology to the Reverend Cake, that
he was allowed to retain his position.</p>

<p class='c017'>But for the fact, indeed, that his children
were still at school and dependent upon his
earnings, and that his wife, who seemed inexplicably
attached to him, had been an invalid
for some years, he would most certainly have
been dismissed, and I had always felt that this
should have been done. Nor was I alone in
this, for when I ventured to congratulate him
on the successful sale of <i>Without are Dogs</i>, the
Reverend Cake had entirely agreed with me in
deploring Mr. Maidstone’s retention in the
business.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such then was the man by whose side I was
now sitting upon the damp pavement, and from
whom I only detached myself after a prolonged
struggle, just as a member of the police force
came in sight. This was a stalwart constable
of somewhat coarse appearance to whom I
immediately made myself known, and to whose
attention I then brought Mr. Maidstone, who
was still seated upon the pavement.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ha, I see,” he said, “a bit sideways. Do
you happen to know where the gentleman
lives?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t know the street,” I said, “nor can
I accept your assumption that such a degenerate
can be called a gentleman. But I understand
that his home is in Greenwich.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Num shixteen,” said Mr. Maidstone.</p>

<p class='c017'>The constable bent over him, and raised him
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now, come along,” he said. “Pull yourself
together.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Maidstone swayed for a moment and then
saluted us.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Happit meetu,” he said. “Num shixteen.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Sixteen what?” said the constable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Manshtroad,” said Mr. Maidstone. “Shixteen
Manshtroad, Grinsh.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Then he toppled forward into the constable’s
arms, but recovered himself and smiled at us
affectionately.</p>

<p class='c017'>The constable turned to me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, if I was you, sir, I’d put him in a
cab and take him home.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I stared at him in utter amazement.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But do you mean to say,” I inquired, “that
you aren’t going to take him in charge?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, no need, sir,” he said, “seeing as you
know the gentleman—not if you’ll put him into
a cab and take him home.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But, my good man,” I said, “how can I do
that? It’s a quarter past ten, and I’m going
home to bed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, we can’t leave him here,” said the
constable, “or he’ll be getting into trouble.
What about givin’ ’im a ’and to your own
’ouse, sir?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“To my own house?” I cried. “A person
in that condition?”</p>

<p class='c017'>The constable pushed his helmet back and
scratched his forehead.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, it’d be doin’ ’im a good turn, sir,”
he said, “seein’ as ’ow the gentleman’s a friend
of yours.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“On the contrary,” I said, “he’s neither a
friend of mine, nor do I propose to condone
his infamy.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here Mr. Maidstone caught hold of the
constable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Shinfamous thing,” he said. “Carncondonit.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Then he sat down again and began to sing a
hymn, just as a second constable came round the
corner; and after conferring for a moment,
they approached me once more with the suggestion
that they should conduct Mr. Maidstone
to Angela Gardens.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You see, sir,” they said, “we don’t want to
make no trouble, and maybe some day you’ll
want a ’and yourself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>For a moment, so casually were the words
spoken, I scarcely realized their astounding
import. But when I did so, it was, of course,
instantly clear to me that I must define my
position once and for all. Drawing myself up,
therefore, I addressed the two constables with
all the firmness of which I was capable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have chosen to be insolent,” I said,
“and for that you may rest assured I shall
report you to your superiors at my earliest
convenience. But I must have you understand,
now and for ever, and beyond all possibility of
future cavil, that I entirely and absolutely
refuse to associate myself with any evasion of
the law of this land. This person, whose name
is Archibald Maidstone, who is employed by
Mr. Chrysostom Lorton of Paternoster Row,
and whose home, if I have interpreted him
rightly, is in Manchester Road, Greenwich, is
not only drunk but, as his actions have proclaimed
him, is also disorderly in every sense.
As a Xtian gentleman, therefore, no less than as
a citizen, whose trousers have been soiled by
his agency, I demand you that you shall do
your duty by removing him to the appropriate
place of detention. And I would further have
you note that I am aware of both your numbers
and shall certainly inform myself of your
procedure.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hear, hear,” said Mr. Maidstone, “more.
Thashway talk to ’em. Manshtroad, Grinsh.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Then the constables conferred again, and
stooping over Mr. Maidstone, lifted him once
more from the pavement.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Very good, sir,” they said, “if you can’t
see your way to look after him, we shall have to
take him to the station.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I bowed to them coldly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Since that was so plainly your duty,” I said,
“I can only regret your tardy perception of it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It will thus be seen that, harassed as I was by
the problem provided for me by Ezekiel Stool,
I was now confronted with the much more
immediate one of purging Mr. Lorton’s business
of Mr. Archibald Maidstone. For to me at
any rate it was imperatively clear that such a
person could not possibly remain in it without
imperilling the whole of the spiritual prestige
that was perhaps its most lucrative asset. At
the same time, however, as I also saw, the
preliminaries to expulsion would require very
careful handling, owing to the choleric temper,
the extreme vanity, and the peculiar limitations
of Mr. Chrysostom himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>After what can well be imagined, therefore,
was a restless night, and not without the profoundest
consideration, I decided upon the seat
of my Sunday trousers as the best introduction
to the subject in hand; and it was with this
in view that I refrained from dusting or drying
them and carried them to the city with me
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nor was I disappointed. For not only did
Miss Botterill, my female inferior, visibly recoil
from them, but they instantly caught the eye
of Mr. Chrysostom Lorton as he crossed the
show-room on the way to his office. Indeed,
disposed as they were, with the seat uppermost,
upon one corner of the right-hand counter,
it would have been difficult for even the most
preoccupied to have passed them without notice,
and especially as the moisture that had been
transferred to them from the pavement was now
being illuminated by the morning sun. Nor
was the effect of them upon Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton less than it had been upon Miss Botterill.
Starting back, almost as if he had been lassoed,
he stood for a moment staring at them with
dilated pupils, and then very softly he approached
them on tip-toe with the point of his umbrella
extended before him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Good God,” he said, “whose are those?”</p>

<p class='c017'>With an appropriate gesture I signified their
ownership. He turned to Miss Botterill.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Fetch me a chair,” he said.</p>

<p class='c017'>She pushed one towards him with averted
eyes. He fell back into it and waved his
hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Take them away,” he said. “Put them
somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I removed them from the counter and placed
them underneath it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Where’s Mr. Maidstone?” he said.</p>

<p class='c017'>I replied that he had not come.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I imagine,” I said, “that he has been
detained.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Detained?” he cried. “Why should he be
detained? What should have detained him?
It’s ten past nine.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Even so,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then kindly inform me,” he went on, “why
you have taken advantage of his absence.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I looked at him gravely.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am not aware,” I said, “of having done
any such thing.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not aware?” he said. “Not aware, sir?
Where’s Miss Botterill? Put this chair back.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He rose to his feet and stood glaring at me,
still pointing his umbrella at the counter.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then do you mean to tell me,” he said,
“that if Mr. Maidstone had been present, your
disgusting wearing apparel would still have
been there?”</p>

<p class='c017'>I bowed my head.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I cannot say,” I replied. “But it was to
call his attention to them that I had placed
them on the counter.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He lowered his umbrella.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To call his attention to them? But what
has Mr. Maidstone to do with your trousers?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“In this particular case,” I said, “a very
great deal, since he was solely responsible for
their condition.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He opened his mouth.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Maidstone?” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Archibald Maidstone,” I said, “your
show-room manager.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But good God,” he said, “you don’t mean
to tell me that he’s in the habit of borrowing
your trousers?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Unfortunately,” I replied, “that was not
necessary. I was myself occupying them on the
occasion in question.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I don’t understand,” he said. “Where’s
Miss Botterill? Bring me that chair back. I
want to sit down.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She brought back the chair, and just as she
did so, the street door opened to admit a new-comer—none
other, indeed, than the Reverend
Eugene Cake, bearing the type-script of his
new novel.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f11'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Gnashers of Teeth.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was an important entrance. But Mr.
Chrysostom still sat staring at the counter,
and having greeted Mr. Cake rather perfunctorily,
demanded a further inspection of the
trousers. Once again therefore I placed them
upon the counter, and once again Miss Botterill
recoiled, the Reverend Eugene Cake recoiling
also and dropping the type-script of his novel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” said Mr. Chrysostom, “you have
already informed me that you were encased in
these nauseating garments, and you have further
asserted that Mr. Maidstone was solely responsible
for their present condition. Mr. Maidstone,
you tell me, is probably detained
somewhere, and it is now a quarter past nine.
I may be unintelligent. I may be obtuse. I
may be unfit to conduct this business. But I
don’t understand it, sir. I don’t understand it.
Where’s Miss Botterill? Get Mr. Cake a chair.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With her hand over her face, Miss Botterill
ran across the show-room and returned with a
chair for Mr. Cake. Mr. Chrysostom glanced at
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you comfortable, Cake?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Reverend Eugene bowed a little stiffly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then,” said Mr. Chrysostom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, I repeat. And now you must
explain, sir. You must explain. I don’t want
to pre-judge you. I never pre-judge anybody.
But I don’t like it, sir. I don’t like it. And
you must allow me to remind you that this is
not the first time that you have obliged me to
discuss your trousers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sir,” I replied, “I am deeply aware of it,
and none can regret it more than myself, nor
the painful circumstances that you have, I
think justly, now compelled me to disclose.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I then very briefly, but with all essential
details, described my encounter with Mr. Maidstone,
concluding with the numbers of the two
constables and a surmise that he was being
detained to see the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I had finished, Mr. Chrysostom was
breathing heavily, while Mr. Cake was engaged
in silent prayer. Then they both rose and
stood with their backs to the trousers while
Mr. Chrysostom gave his orders.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Botterill,” he said, “when Mr. Maidstone
arrives, you will please request him to
come to my room. Mr. Carp, having removed
your trousers, you will kindly take charge of
the show-room.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Colouring deeply, Mr. Cake touched him on
the arm. “I suppose you refer,” he said, “to
the trousers on the counter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Eh, what?” said Mr. Chrysostom. “Yes,
yes, of course. The trousers on the counter.
You didn’t suppose——?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I endeavoured not to,” said Mr. Cake.
“But perhaps it would have been better to be
more explicit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Slightly ruffled, however, as was the eminent
novelist by the occasion and manner of his
reception, he was completely emphatic, as he
afterwards assured me, on the necessity for
dismissing Mr. Maidstone; and indeed Mr.
Chrysostom, as he also informed me, had
needed very little in the way of persuasion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In fact, I think I may say,” he said, a
couple of hours later, as he passed through the
show-room on his way to the street, “that
<i>Gnashers of Teeth</i> will find a good friend in Mr.
Maidstone’s successor.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I clasped his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I sincerely hope so,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s even more powerful,” he said, “than
<i>Without are Dogs</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in this fashion then that I became
show-room manager with an added, though
insufficient emolument, for Mr. Maidstone, when
he arrived the next morning, was at once dismissed
after a brief interview. Explaining at
first that he had failed to attend owing to a
very violent bilious headache, he was of course
unable, when pressed by Mr. Chrysostom, to
deny the truth of my allegations; and it
subsequently emerged that, after a night in the
police station, he had been fined ten shillings
by the local magistrate. Nor did his resentment,
when he came downstairs again, assume
the physical character that I had feared,
although I had taken the precaution of keeping
Miss Botterill beside me and holding my police
whistle in my left hand. On the contrary, he
seemed to recognize not only the grossness of
his delinquency, but the inevitable nature of
the consequences that had so rightly ensued.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, you’ve done me in, laddie,” he said.
“But I suppose I deserved it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I regret to say,” I replied, “that there can
be no doubt of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it’s going to be hard,” he added, “on
the wife and family.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The wages of sin,” I said, “are never
easy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Miss Botterill sniffed and pulled out her
handkerchief, and Mr. Maidstone closed the
street door, and but for a diverting sequel upon
the following Friday, the incident closed very
satisfactorily. Upon that morning, however,
Mr. Maidstone’s three elder children, a girl
and two boys, all apparently under fourteen,
entered the show-room and peremptorily demanded
to be taken upstairs to Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton. By names, Polly, Arthur, and George,
they had come to apply for their father’s
reinstatement, chiefly, as they alleged, on account
of their mother, whom they described as suffering
from pulmonary consumption. Needless to
say, much to their obvious discomfiture, Mr.
Chrysostom refused to see them, and after a
brief consultation, they filed out again very
much more humbly than they had come in.
Unpleasant children, it was an amusing episode,
and I could not help laughing somewhat heartily,
although Polly, who appeared to be the eldest,
made a grimace at me as she went out.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Happy years. A typical day. Simeon Whey is at last
ordained. His first sermon at St. Sepulchre’s, Balham.
Intensive campaign of the <i>A.D.S.U.</i> I meet Miss Moonbeam
and call her Mary. Affecting appeal not to leave
her in darkness. I promise not to do so. A face to
lean on. Will I come again? Adventure on the stage
of the Empresses Theatre.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>I have</span> said that this incident ended satisfactorily,
but, as I shall very shortly have to demonstrate,
it was subsequently to become associated
with what I have always regarded as the most
tragic event of my career—an event so annihilating
in its ultimate consequences, and so
misunderstood in its immediate details, that
few less proven and resilient characters could
have emerged from it unimpaired. Nor could
my physique, I think, have stood the strain
but for the four or five years that now intervened,
during which I was enabled, in a life of
comparative calm, to add very considerably
to my bodily weight. Indeed in many respects,
uneventful as they were, these were amongst
the happiest years of my earlier manhood,
and I cannot do better, perhaps, than describe
for the benefit of my readers a typical day of
this period of my life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Required, like my father, who was still fortunately
able to pursue his secular avocations,
to be present at my place of employment by
nine o’clock in the morning, my mother would
call me at a quarter past seven, bringing a cup
of tea to my bedside. This I would permit
to cool for three or four minutes while I ate one
of the biscuits with which it was accompanied;
and then, sitting up in bed with my dressing-gown
over my shoulders, I would drink the upper
half of it before again eating. I would then eat
the second of my two biscuits, and having drunk
the remainder of the tea, would ring for my
mother, who would then bring my hot water
prior to the removal of the tea-things.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was now ready to dress, and pushing down
the bedclothes, would begin by leaning forward
and reaching the trousers which, the night before,
I had hung over the end of the bed, with this
very purpose in view. Containing my pants,
to the lower extremities of which my socks
would be still adherent, I was thus enabled,
without removing my nightgown, to clothe my
lower limbs before actually rising; and it was
only then that I would finally leave the bed and
cross the room towards the wash-hand stand.
I would then fill the basin, leaving sufficient
hot water for the purposes of subsequent shaving,
and having locked the door and drawn the blinds
would remove my nightgown preparatory to
washing.</p>

<p class='c014'>It would now be half-past seven, and if it
were at all cold, I would don my vest before
bending over the basin, never failing, however,
in even the severest weather, to roll up my
sleeves as far as my elbows. Then having dried
and put on my shirt, I would shave before putting
on my shirt-front, always brushing my hair
before I put on my coat, but not before
putting on my waistcoat. I would then select
a clean handkerchief from my top right-hand
drawer, and having pulled up my trousers a
little to prevent them from becoming baggy,
would kneel by my bedside at seven forty-five,
assuming an erect position again at five minutes
to eight. I would then pull up the blinds, open
the windows, fold up my nightgown and put
it in my nightgown bag, and by eight o’clock
would be sitting at the harmonium in readiness
to burst into the morning hymn.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus begun, and breakfast having been
concluded, the day would next behold me
inside an omnibus, unless the weather were warm
enough to permit of my sitting upon the top
for the purpose of rebuking adjacent smokers;
and punctually at nine o’clock, I would enter
the show-room and divest myself of my hat,
scarf and overcoat. I would then exchange a
courteous word or two with Miss Botterill
and the youth who had succeeded me as show-room
assistant, and immediately apply myself
to the various duties that as show-room manager
devolved upon my shoulders. Comprising the
arrangement of books upon the shelves and
counters, as well as of an attractive display in
the street window, these would include, of course,
my personal attendance upon the more important
of our retail customers, the booking of
orders, the checking of the show-room takings,
and the maintenance of discipline amongst my
two subordinates. And I had long ago proved
the necessity, in view of such diverse demands,
of paying the utmost attention to my physical
upkeep.</p>

<p class='c014'>At eleven o’clock, therefore, I would despatch
Miss Botterill to a neighbouring branch of the
Aerated Bread Company for a glass of hot milk
and a substantial slice of a cake appropriately
known as lunch cake. I would then, at twelve-thirty,
repair in person to the same branch of
this valuable company, where I would generally
order from one of the quieter waitresses a double
portion of sausages and mashed potatoes, accompanied
by a cup of coffee, and followed by an
apple dumpling or a segment of baked jam roll.
This was the more necessary because the hour
from one to two was usually the busiest of the
working day, while from two to three, when my
subordinates lunched in turn, I had of course
only one of them to assist me.</p>

<p class='c014'>By three o’clock, however, they had both
returned, and I would take the opportunity,
five minutes later, of again sending Miss Botterill
to the Aerated Bread Company for my mid-afternoon
cup of tea. This I would drink,
unthickened by food, but at half-past four I
would send her out for another cup, and with
this I would eat a roll and butter, a small dish
of honey, and perhaps a single doughnut.
Thus fortified I would then continue at work
until six o’clock, when the show-room closed,
and at half-past six I was sitting down at home
to the chief meal of the evening. Taken somewhat
earlier than had been my father’s custom
in the days of my boyhood and adolescence,
I had found myself obliged to insist on the alteration
in view of the many demands upon my
evening hours. Most of my active work, for
example, at the doors of public houses, required
an attendance from seven to nine, while few
of the local prayer-meetings began at a later
hour than half-past seven or eight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Early as was this meal, however, it was none
the less welcome, consisting as it usually did
of a joint and two vegetables followed by a
wholesome pudding, tea, bread and jam, and
perhaps a slice or two of home-made cake.
Then after evening prayers, I would embrace
my father, who was now always in bed by a
quarter to nine, and leave the house upon some
such holy errand as I have described in the
previous paragraph. I did not fail, however,
on returning home, to drink a bowl of arrowroot
and eat some digestive biscuits, and whenever
possible, in the interests of my health, I would
retire to my bedroom at ten-fifteen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here I would find my windows closed for
the night, the blinds drawn for the sake of
decency, a jug of hot water standing in my basin,
while a hot-water bottle would be within the
bed. All would be in readiness, therefore,
for my quick disrobing, a process that I would
begin as soon as I had locked the door; and
within five minutes, I would be bending over
the basin clad as I have described myself some
fifteen hours earlier. I would then brush my
teeth, using some mild disinfectant, open my
nightgown bag and extract my nightgown,
and having taken off my vest, would slip on
my nightgown prior to the removal of my lower
garments. These I would then detach from
myself with a single downward movement,
subsequently hanging them over the end of
the bed, after which I would put on my dressing-gown
and bedroom slippers and utter a brief
but fervent supplication. I would then pull
up the blinds so that the stars could shine upon
my bed, swallow a tablespoonful of the Adult
Gripe Water, unlock the door, extinguish the
light, and by ten thirty-five be composed for
slumber.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was a typical day of this period of my
life, during which, as I have said, I increased
in weight, and in which, as I am glad to believe,
my moral stature also expanded and became
consolidated. This was at any rate the conviction
of my friend Simeon Whey, who took
the opportunity of my twenty-sixth birthday
to describe me in his diary as ‘now in the
full flower of his southern metropolitan Xtian
manhood.’ Indeed the whole passage is well
worth transcribing, written as it was on the eve
of his ordination, and following a happy hour
together discussing the price lists of various
clerical tailors.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘By a moving coincidence,’ he wrote, ‘the
eve of my ordination has coincided with the
twenty-sixth birthday of my old and dear friend
Augustus Carp of Angela Gardens. And yet
perhaps old is scarcely the right word, for mature
as he is, he is now in the full flower of his southern
metropolitan Xtian manhood. Nor have I
ever seen him looking so large as when he came
to see me at 2.35 to receive the hand-painted
tooth-brush, with which I had promised to
present him, and to give me his benediction
for the morrow. Fully a stone heavier than this
time last year, his moustache has become
noticeably more abundant, and his every movement
possesses the weight and gravity of a man
twenty years his senior. Admirable as was his
diction, too, even as a boy, it has now attained
a level of sonorous grandeur, from which it
never lapses in even the most trivial pronouncements
imposed upon him by necessary human
intercourse. Is it surprising, therefore, that
I daily thank P,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> for so noble and inspiring an
example?’</p>

<p><i>The Rev Simeon Whey from a photograph in my possession</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Dear Simeon, loyal and appreciative, for
many a long year hadst thou been trying to get
ordained, but now thou hadst succeeded, and
well do I remember thy first sermon at St.
Sepulchre’s, Balham. Cast thy bread, thou
preachedst, upon the waters, for thou shalt
find it after many days—and mark, thou didst
say, it is not demanded of us to cast our jewels
or financial securities. No, no, thou saidst,
it was well recognized that the former would
sink and the latter become unintelligible, whereas
bread was nutriment for the fishes of the deep,
and in due course would return to our tables.
Moreover bread was cheap, thou didst say,
and even the poorest of us was sometimes
tempted to waste his bread, and for him there
was a message—kck—in these beautiful words
to place his bread, as it were, out at interest.
Let us all then take heed, thou saidst, never to
waste our bread but to collect it earnestly with
both hands, and whenever we saw any water,
yea no matter how little, to cast it upon it in
faith fearing not. And then it would return
to us, if not in the form of fish, then in some
other form which we wotted not of. For what
was bred in the bone could never be cast down,
nay, not until seventy times seven.</p>

<p class='c014'>Good Simeon, such was thy first sermon, and
I doubt if thou hast ever preached a better.</p>

<p class='c014'>Little as we dreamt it, however, Providence
was now hurrying towards me with the heaviest
cross of my adult life, a cross so heavy that even
now I cannot help shuddering at its weight,
and one that compelled me not only to retire
from business but to remove from Camberwell
to Stoke Newington. Nor was it less bitter in
that the instrument of deposit was a young
and exceptionally attractive female, with whom
I had been brought into contact in the course of
my work for the Anti-Dramatic and Saltatory
Union.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was about a year after Simeon’s ordination
and soon after I had inaugurated, in my
capacity as Vice-President, an intensive campaign
of personal exhortation at all the most
notorious West End theatres. Thus I had
arranged that there should be posted at the
stage entrances of all these more popular haunts
of vice earnest young workers of the male sex
plentifully provided with the Union’s literature.
These would then approach the in-coming actors
and actresses with a few well-chosen words of
warning, pointing out to them the iniquity of
their occupation and inviting them to embrace
some other profession. Having had our evening
meals, Ezekiel and myself would each then
visit a group of theatres to encourage our
representatives and lend them the personal
aid of our riper experience and more gifted
oratory.</p>

<p class='c014'>This then was the occasion of my being present
at about half-past seven on a January evening
at the stage door of the Empresses Theatre,
where a play called <i>The Peach Girl</i> was about
to be performed. This was a drama, accompanied
by music, and frequently interrupted,
I believe, by amatory dances, which had already
been presented nearly three hundred times and
was still attracting enormous audiences. I
had not myself seen it, but Ezekiel, who had
witnessed a considerable portion of it before
making his protest at its first performance, had
particularly deplored the abbreviated costumes
of most of the female dancers. He had made
an exception, however, in favour of the principal
actress, by whose singular beauty he had been
greatly impressed, and in whom he had discerned,
he thought, in spite of her surroundings, an
appreciable degree of natural goodness. By
name Mary Moonbeam, she had been assigned
the part, it appeared, of a quite simple seller
of fruit, to whom a naval officer, accompanied
upon the stage by a large number of female
midshipmen, had immediately begun, in a
voluptuous baritone, to address words of
affection.</p>

<p class='c014'>What had happened subsequently Ezekiel did
not of course know, since he had then made his
protest and been compelled to leave. But he
had felt assured, from the sweetness of her
expression, that she had been more sinned against
than sinning, and that in other surroundings she
might easily have developed into an almost ideal
district visitor. On the other hand, it was
quite clear, from the letter-press outside the
theatre, that she was the chief attraction of the
play, and she had twice refused to discuss her
future with our young representative at the
stage door.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was with as open a mind, therefore, as it
was at all possible for me to possess in respect
of an actress, that I perceived her alighting
from an expensive-looking vehicle soon after
I had reached the stage door. Nor was I at
first able, owing to the speed of her movements—she
was ten minutes later, it appeared, than
usual—and the voluminous furs, in which she
had ensconced herself, to obtain a clear view
of her face. In fact, when I first touched her,
she brushed me aside, and it was only after she
had glanced at me a second time that she
stopped for a moment and began to stare
at me with her exceptionally limpid, hazel
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hullo,” she said, “you’re not the same
man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am the Vice-President,” I said, “of the
Anti-Dramatic Union.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Saltatory,” she said. “Don’t forget
the Saltatory part.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would that it were possible,” I replied.
“But it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She gave a little sigh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I suppose not,” she said, “not with all
us girls earning our living by it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And hurling others,” I said, “to their
deaths.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, no,” she said, “not really?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every night,” I replied, “in thousands and
thousands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, good gracious,” she said, “not every
night?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every night,” I said, “in thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But goodness me,” she cried, “that’s more
than ever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s more and more,” I said, “every night.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I never,” she said. “What a fearful
mortality.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fearful indeed,” I replied, “and you are
responsible.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, my aunt,” she said, “how perfectly
horrible. Can’t you come and talk to me after
the first act?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should be only too glad,” I said, “if you
would tell me where to come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, anybody’ll tell you,” she said. “Nine-fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she disappeared, and at a quarter past
nine, when I returned to the theatre after consulting
Ezekiel, I was eventually shown into
a small room, where she appeared to be undressing
herself to a marked extent. She waved
her hand, however, and bade me take a chair,
assuring me that the worst was already over,
and introducing me to a woman, whom she
described as her dresser, and whose name was
Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is Mr. Carp,” she said, “the Vice-President
of the Anti-Dramatic and Saltatory
Union.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Montgomery wiped her hands on her
apron prior to greeting me with great cordiality.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Happy to meet you,” she said. “I’ve
read a lot of your tracts, and mark my words,
there’s a lot of truth in ’em.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Miss Moonbeam, “and isn’t it
awful, Bags?<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> He says we kill thousands of
people every night.”</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f13'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Presumably an abbreviation of Montgomery.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I shouldn’t wonder,” said Mrs. Montgomery,
“not for a moment, I shouldn’t.
What with this modern dancing and all. Hold
your chin up, dearie.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was applying some powder to Miss Moonbeam’s
neck, and presently stood back a little,
eyeing her critically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Miss Moonbeam. “But oughtn’t
we to do something? It doesn’t seem right
just to let it go on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, no,” I cried. “Nor it is. Nor it is,
Miss Moonbeam. Believe me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do,” she said. “I do believe you. Get
out of the light, Bags. I want to look at
him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I sat in silence, permitting her
to feast her eyes. Then she bent forward a
little, holding out her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Mr. Carp,” she said, “I’m only a poor
actress. Help me to be better. Help me to be
like you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Withdrawing my gloves and putting them in
my left-hand pocket, I advanced towards her
and took hold of her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Miss Moonbeam,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>But she looked at me rather pathetically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Mr. Carp,” she said, “won’t you call
me Mary?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I considered for a moment. It was a difficult
position. For though I could not help feeling
that she was a little presumptuous, I had to
remember that this was probably the first
occasion on which she had met a really good
man. I therefore decided to grant her petition.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Mary,” I said, “I shall be only
too happy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She breathed a sigh and removed her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, how lovely of you,” she said. “Now
I must go on dressing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Mary,” I said, “is that necessary?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I think so,” she said. “You see, if
I didn’t——”</p>

<p class='c014'>I waved my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m afraid you’ve misunderstood me,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very likely,” she said. “I’m so stupid.
But you’re going to help me, Mr. Carp, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing could please me more,” I said,
“than to lead you out of darkness into the
membership of our Union. But would it not
be better to rise up at once—to rise up at once,
I say, and come away?”</p>

<p class='c014'>But she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see, I’m bound by a contract,” she
said, “and I have to support rather a large
family.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Involuntarily I staggered a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Mary,” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Brothers and sisters,” she explained. “I’m
paying for their education.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Profoundly relieved, and not a little touched,
I regained my equilibrium and invited her to
confide in me. Her mother was dead, it appeared,
and her father had been unfortunate and was
now unable to provide for his children.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so they batten,” I said, “on your ill-gotten
earnings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She turned and looked at me for a moment
in silence. Then she smiled again as she put
on her slippers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You seem to understand things,” she said,
“so quickly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a small boy looked round the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Curtain’s up, miss,” he said and disappeared
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear, oh dear,” she cried, “how the
time flies. Can’t you come and talk to me after
the show?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I smiled at her not unkindly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“By ten-fifteen,” I said, “I shall be in my
bedroom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what am I to do?” she said. “I’ve
begun to lean on you. You aren’t going to
leave me here wallowing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wallowing in what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, in the darkness,” she said, “killing
all those people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I took her hands again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Mary,” I said, “it is in order to
remove you that I am here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She gave a little sigh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I was sure I could trust you,” she said.
“I knew I could trust you, the moment I saw
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it’s his face,” said Mrs. Montgomery.
“Isn’t it, dearie? It’s one of those faces one
wants to lean on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, yes,” she cried, “with all one’s
weight. Couldn’t you bring it round to-morrow
after the matinée? And then very likely you’ll
meet some of my friends, and perhaps you’ll
be able to remove us all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But not before six,” I said, “or a quarter
past.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’ll do nicely,” she said. “There’s my
call.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she ran from the room, just as an electric
bell began to sound in the corner, and Mrs.
Montgomery was kind enough to tell me the
quickest way to leave the theatre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately, however, she was either inaccurate,
or by some odd chance I failed to understand
her, for a moment later I found myself
on the stage, just as the naval officer was about
to embrace Miss Moonbeam. By a curious
coincidence, too, my appearance synchronized
with the dramatic utterance by Miss Moonbeam
of the words, ‘Hush, Reginald, he comes,’
which added for the moment to my perplexity.
For while it was possible (and this proved to be
the case) that the words bore reference to some
fellow-actor, it was also possible, I thought,
that she might have been informing him of my
own presence in the theatre. Nor could I
be certain from the attitude of the audience,
as it unanimously rose with roars of applause,
that my recent efforts to rescue their favourite
might not have become known to it and touched
its heart. I conceived it my duty, therefore,
without prejudicing my position, to make a
courteous bow or two before retiring, and I
took the opportunity of handing the naval
officer an illustrated copy of <i>Did Wycliffe Waltz?</i></p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Disappointing attitude of Ezekiel. Suggested nuptials of
Miss Moonbeam. An occasion for tact and postponement.
I am obliged to write a letter. Ezekiel accompanies
me to the Empresses Theatre. We are a little
taken back by the numbers to be rescued. An apparently
delightful beverage. I address Miss Moonbeam’s
friends on the subject of temperance. Ezekiel addresses
them on the evils of the drama. We arrange a meeting.
Description of meeting.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Afterwards</span>, as I have suggested, I was to
discover in Miss Moonbeam an almost incredible
capacity for evil. But that night, as I emerged
from the theatre into the anxious arms of
Ezekiel Stool, I could not help feeling in the
utmost agreement with him as to her character
and physical appearance. Indeed so complete
was my endorsement both of his judgment
and prevision that I must confess to having
been a little surprised by his reception of my
news.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So you’re meeting her again?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, to-morrow evening,” I replied, “when
I hope to draw closer to her in every way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stopped abruptly and began to peer at
me suspiciously through the dense tangle that
now covered his face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you mean closer?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I waved my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has so much to learn,” I said, “so
much to understand. She’s like a little child,
Ezekiel, just as you supposed—a female child
that has never been properly taught.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, very likely,” he said. “But why
shouldn’t I teach her myself? I’m the President
of the Union after all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I said, “undoubted
as are your gifts both as organizer and financer
of our movement, do you really consider that
you have quite the personality for such intimate
soul-work as Miss Moonbeam requires?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Absolutely,” said Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I can only say,” I replied, “that I
fail to agree with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was an awkward moment, and it was not
until the third attempt that Ezekiel succeeded
in making himself intelligible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so you mean to imply,” he said, “that
for the purposes of approaching Miss Moonbeam,
your personality is superior to mine?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I touched his arm, not without affection.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Or shall we rather say,” I replied, “that
it is more attractive?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I deny it,” he cried. “I deny it most
passionately. I deny it with every fibre of my
being,”</p>

<p class='c014'>I withdrew my glove for a moment from his
coat-sleeve.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I said, “that doesn’t
alter the position.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The position?” he said. “What position?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, the position,” I replied, “between
Mary and myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment the silence was almost terrifying.
Then he dropped his umbrella, and I put
my foot upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Between who?” he said. “Between who?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Between Mary,” I repeated, “and myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But do you mean to tell me,” he cried,
“that as Vice-President—as Vice-President, I
say, of a Union such as ours——”</p>

<p class='c014'>I touched his sleeve again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Or shall we say <i>an</i> Union, seeing that
Union begins with a vowel?”</p>

<p class='c014'>But he stamped his foot, evidently losing
self-control.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, we won’t,” he screamed. “We won’t
say <i>an</i> Union. Why should we say <i>an</i> Union
if we don’t want to? We don’t say <i>an</i> Youth
or <i>an</i> Yew-tree.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Simply,” I replied, “because the two latter
words happen to be inaugurated with a consonant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I deny it,” he shouted. “I deny it
most passionately. I deny it with every fibre
of my being.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I stood aghast. Hitherto I
had been conciliatory. But here was a question
upon which there could be no compromise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Ezekiel Stool,” I said, “as man to
man—nay, as Xtian gentleman to Xtian gentleman—do
you mean to tell me that you are
prepared to deny that the word Yew-tree begins
with a Y?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I don’t,” he said, “I deny it completely.
I deny it with all the vehemence at
my command.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But I held up my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just a moment,” I said. “This is a matter,
Ezekiel, upon which I must be absolutely clear.
Do you mean to deny that the word does begin
with a Y? Or do you mean to deny that you
meant to tell me that you were prepared to
deny that it did?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I deny it all,” said Ezekiel. “I deny the
whole thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I said, “that is
impossible.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how can it be impossible,” he said,
“if I’ve just done it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because the two alternatives,” I replied,
“are contradictory.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I deny them both,” he said. “I
deny them utterly. I deny them to the utmost
limit of my capacity,”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But by denying one,” I said, “you affirm
the other, and by denying the other you affirm
the first.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I deny neither,” he said. “I deny
neither of them. I deny neither of them to
my last breath.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you affirm both?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Absolutely and entirely,” he said, “to the
remotest follicle of my manhood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But that leaves us,” I said, “just as we
were.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very likely,” he replied. “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I don’t understand,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor do I,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>We stood staring at one another in silence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then we’d better go back,” I said, “to
the original Yew-tree.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What Yew-tree?” enquired Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, the one you referred to,” I said, “as
not requiring an <i>an</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I’ve already told you,” he said, “that
I deny that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I said, “you can’t
deny things like that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I not only can,” he said, “but I do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you’ll soon be denying,” I cried, “that
I’m the Vice-President of the Anti-Dramatic
and Saltatory Union.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I certainly shall,” he said, “if you continue
to go about referring to actresses by
their Xtian names.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I said, “it was
entirely at her own request that I referred to
Miss Moonbeam as Mary.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stepped back a pace, obviously shaken.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean to tell me,” he said, “that
she asked you to?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Most certainly,” I replied, “and if you
would like to hear them, I can repeat her actual
words.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Please do,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Oh, Mr. Carp,’” I said, “‘won’t you call
me Mary?’”</p>

<p class='c014'>His face brightened a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then she didn’t call you Augustus?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She hasn’t done so,” I answered, “as yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And perhaps she never will,” he said, “never
will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t quite see,” I said, “why you should
say that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps not,” he replied. “But I do say
it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course I shouldn’t encourage her to,”
I said, “until she had altered her profession.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And perhaps she won’t,” he said, “perhaps
she won’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Won’t what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alter her profession.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But don’t you want her to?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, of course,” he said. “But they seldom
do, you know, unless they marry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Precisely,” I said, “unless they marry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He opened his mouth for a moment, but only
breathed through it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you don’t mean to tell me,” he said,
“that as Vice-President——?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It might be my duty,” I said, “to sacrifice
myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So much as that?” he said. “So much as
that, Augustus?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He covered his eyes for a moment with his
gloved hands. Then he suddenly remembered
that he had dropped his umbrella.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s here,” I said, “under my foot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, thank you,” he said, “thank you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he held out his hands to me with frank
contrition.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, my dear friend,” he said, “forgive me
for misjudging you. But as your President, I
could never permit it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But why not?” I said, trying to release
my hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, because as President,” he cried, “it
is clearly the sort of sacrifice that I ought to
make myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I don’t see why,” I said, again trying
to release myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But don’t you see,” he cried, still holding
my hands, “how symbolic it would then
become—the marriage of one of the most
prominent of our younger ex-actresses with the
Anti-Dramatic and Saltatory Union?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she wouldn’t be marrying the Union,”
I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not if she married you,” he said, “who are
merely the Vice-President. But if she married
me, Augustus, it would be different. It
would become the sacrifice of the whole
Union.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I said, “ought you
to sacrifice the whole Union without consulting
all its members?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, but I should,” he said, “I certainly
should, and any that objected I should ask to
resign.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I reflected for a moment. Admirable as was
his character, it was in many respects singularly
bigoted, while his intelligence, sometimes
so brilliant, was at others inferior even to that
of his sisters. Since the burial of his parents,
too, a couple of years previously, and the
consequent augmentation of his own income, I
had been conscious in him of a rather unexpected
and somewhat disturbing vein of arrogance.
I therefore decided, for the present at
any rate, that the wisest policy was one of
postponement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely in that case,” I said, “they
should have an opportunity of seeing her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, of course,” he said, “of course.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Before they married her, I mean—as an
Union.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, certainly,” he said, “certainly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then his hair parted for a moment, revealing
his teeth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In fact I was just going to suggest,” he
smiled, “asking her to one of our meetings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll certainly do so,” I said. “I’ll ask her
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well both ask her,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you won’t be there,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I shall,” he answered. “I shall come
with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she hasn’t invited you,” I said, again
trying to free my hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Augustus,” he said, gripping
them a little tighter, “surely you don’t expect
me to wait for that? Does the powerful
swimmer refrain from plunging until the drowning
victim has asked him to do so, or the
hurrying policeman refuse to cut the rope
because the would-be suicide has not invited
it? Does the fireman hesitate before the
smouldering nightgown until the female inside
it has shown him her card?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps not,” I said, stepping a pace
backwards.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly not,” he said, following me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But on the other hand,” I said, stepping
sideways, “if a powerful swimmer has already
plunged, if a hurrying policeman is already
there, if a soaring fireman has already
stooped——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then that is all the more reason,” he said,
also stepping sideways, “why the hero should
be helped as I mean to help you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I can’t promise,” I said, “that she
will be willing to receive you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not when she knows,” he asked, “that
I’m the Adult Gripe Water?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, she might,” I said. “I’ll do my best,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Augustus,” he replied, “I thought you
would.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he dropped my hands, now seriously
congested, and stooping down, picked up his
umbrella.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And I don’t want you to feel,” he added,
“now that I propose to take charge of the
work, that your share in it has been unappreciated.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then we climbed into the omnibus that was
to take us to Camberwell and sat side by side
in it in silence, parting as usual, however, with
a mutual benediction, though I could not conceal
from myself that his attitude had disappointed
me. For though it would have been
inevitable, and indeed desirable, that subsequent
to redemption Miss Moonbeam should
have met him, this was scarcely the moment, I
felt, for the sudden intrusion of a second
deliverer. Nor were the nuptials that he had
proposed for her other than profoundly distasteful
to me, though a glance at my mirror
sufficed to reassure me of their extreme unlikelihood.
Nevertheless I deemed it wise before
retiring to bed to send a brief note to Miss
Moonbeam, regretting the pertinacity that would
probably result in my being accompanied by
Ezekiel, but at the same time indicating that
he was not to be dismissed as a wholly valueless
acquaintance. “Nor must you forget,” I concluded,
“that he is at least the President of
the great Union that has brought us together.”
A difficult letter, it had needed all the tact
that I had been able to summon to its composition,
and the clock had struck eleven, I
remember, before I was able to open my nightgown
bag, preparatory to taking out my
nightgown.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was a little pale, therefore, when I arrived
at the theatre at six o’clock the next evening,
and though fully confident of my ability to
control the situation, I was naturally somewhat
anxious as to the effect upon Miss Moonbeam
of a night’s consideration. Had the latent
thirst for a higher life, that my person
had aroused in her the night before, been
submerged again by wicked companions or
quickened by my absence? Had she gone to
sleep dreaming of the footlights or of an Anti-Dramatic
and Saltatory future? And how had
the poor child, reared in sin and ignorance,
received the letter that I had been obliged to
write to her?</p>

<p class='c014'>Such were the questions that occupied my
mind as Ezekiel came hurrying to meet me
and we walked upstairs to the same room
in which I had talked with her the night before.
For the first moment, too, I was a trifle dazzled
both by the brilliance of its illumination and
the clamour of conversation that greeted our
entrance from the large number of persons
whom we found assembled in it. This died
down instantly, however, when our names were
announced, and as we stood framed for a
moment in the doorway, nothing could have
been more striking than the effect of our
presence upon the actors and actresses huddled
before us. I say huddled because, as so often
happens when evil-doers are taken by surprise,
they had unanimously winced and drawn closer
together, while at least two of them had murmured
“Help!” Moreover, it was quite clear
that some of them had been drinking, since
their wine glasses were still in their hands,
and indeed I was almost certain, to my deep
consternation, that Miss Moonbeam herself had
been one of these.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Her hands were empty,
however, when she came forward to greet us,
and although Ezekiel had abruptly stiffened, I
could not see my way to refuse the manual
courtesy, to which she was evidently looking
forward.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f14'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I am now, alas, convinced of this.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Mr. Carp,” she said, “this is indeed
sweet of you. I was beginning to be afraid
that you weren’t coming.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Miss Moonbeam,” I began.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mary,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Mary,” I said, “I never break my
word.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, you wouldn’t,” she said, “and my
friends will be so pleased. Let me introduce
you to them. This is Mr. Augustus Carp.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed to them gravely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you’ve brought your friend,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The President of our Union,” I said, “Mr.
Ezekiel Stool.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She held out her hand to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sure we shall be great friends,” she
said. But he was still staring suspiciously at
her colleagues.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’ve been drinking,” he said. “What
have they been drinking?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, nothing much,” she said. “Only my
health.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your health?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it’s my birthday,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Miss Mary,” I said. “Let me
congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, yes,” said Ezekiel. “But what’s
the fluid?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He tilted his face a little, sniffing the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I see,” said Miss Moonbeam. “How
stupid of me. Reggie, come forward and show
them your glass.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She glanced over her shoulder, and a young
man, whom I instantly recognized as the naval
officer, then approached us carrying a wine
glass filled with a dark, translucent liquid.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s delightful stuff,” he said. “It is really.
Won’t you taste a little before you begin your
sermon?”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Ezekiel started back, gripping my left
elbow, while the hair covering his face extended
itself protectively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” he cried. “Augustus, keep close
to me. I don’t like the smell of it. Ask him
what it’s made of.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew myself up a little, facing the naval
officer, while Ezekiel clung to my elbow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must pardon us,” I said, “but in addition
to our connection with the Anti-Dramatic
and Saltatory Union, we are also officials—and
in this particular work, I hold a higher position
than my comrade—we are also officials of the
Society for the Prevention of the Strong Drink
Traffic. It is therefore not only important to
us, since we have been invited to rescue you,
to learn whether this also is one of your vices,
but doubly necessary that we ourselves should
take every possible precaution. You will consequently
perceive, I hope, the imperative necessity
of our assuring ourselves, before we partake of
it, that the composition of the liquor you have
proffered us is such as our consciences can
approve of.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I’m sure of it,” he said. “Just smell
it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Personally,” I replied, “I do not object to
the smell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the taste,” he added, “is even
pleasanter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can quite believe it,” I said. “But what
is it made of?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, just fruit,” said Miss Moonbeam. “It’s
a sort of fruit squash, you know—a fruit squash,
made of fruit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ezekiel advanced a little and put his face
against it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I prefer the colour,” he said, “to the smell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, isn’t it beautiful?” said the naval
officer, and several of the other actors said the
same thing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what’s it called?” said Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Portugalade,” said Miss Moonbeam.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s because it comes from Portugal,”
said the naval officer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And one gets used to the smell,” said
Ezekiel. “But why does one drink it out of
wine glasses?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, but one needn’t,” said Miss Moonbeam.
“One can drink it out of tumblers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“One just used wine glasses,” said the naval
officer, “because one happened to find them
in the cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at him piercingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely that seems to indicate,” I said,
“that they have been used for other and less
innocent beverages.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He hung his head, and as my glance swept
his companions, I observed that most of them
hung theirs also.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he lifted it again, not without a certain
honesty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Carp,” he said, “it’s no use deceiving
you. And I’m afraid I must confess that I
haven’t confined myself to such health-giving
drinks as this Portugalade.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor we,” said his companions. “Nor we.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But we hope to do better,” said Miss Moonbeam,
“in the future.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, ladies and gentlemen,” I said, sipping
the Portugalade, which seemed to me exceptionally
agreeable, “I can only implore you—and
I speak not only for myself but for my
friend Mr. Stool——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of the Adult Gripe Water,” said Ezekiel.
“It was invented by my late father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t say so?” said the naval officer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was that what made him late?” asked
Miss Moonbeam.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ezekiel stared at her over the glass of Portugalade,
which I had handed on to him before
beginning my speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you mean late?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wasn’t that what you said?” asked Miss
Moonbeam.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, but I meant dead,” said Ezekiel.
“He’s been dead some time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t mean it?” said the naval officer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. It’s rather nice,” said Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see,” said Miss Moonbeam. “You didn’t
get on together?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I meant the Portugalade,” said Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“—I can only implore you,” I continued,
“while there’s still time—before the craving for
stimulants has finally overcome you—to cast
them away from you with both hands, to
crush them under foot, to leave them for ever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I glanced at Ezekiel, who was wiping his
mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And, ladies and gentlemen,” I said, “why
should you hesitate? Have you not here—or
had you not there, rather—in the very glass
that my friend has just emptied, a drink as
genial, as palatable and invigorating as the
most debauched of you could desire?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have, we have,” they cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, ladies and gentlemen,” I said, “before
we further address you on the evils of the
drama, may I not beg of you to make up your
minds to drink nothing less healthful than this
in the future?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You may, you may,” they said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I turned to Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I’ll ask Mr. Stool,” I said, “to
inaugurate our second appeal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I then stood aside while Ezekiel cleared his
throat preparatory to delivering his usual oration,
and it was during the course of this that
Miss Moonbeam drew me aside and informed
me how much she had appreciated my letter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought it was so dear of you,” she said,
“to let your friend down without seeming to
want to do anything of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was certainly difficult,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you managed it so beautifully,” she
said. “How long do you suppose he will go
on speaking?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Twenty minutes,” I said. “This is his
half-hour harangue.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was looking a little pale, I thought.
But she smiled bravely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I suppose we deserve it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, undoubtedly,” I replied, “and he wants
you to attend one of our meetings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What—all of us?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You would all be welcome,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And would you be there too?” she asked,
pressing my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, of course,” I said, permitting her to
continue pressing, “I am the Vice-President.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here Ezekiel paused for a moment and
glanced at us keenly. But Miss Moonbeam at
once smiled at him and clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t think he’s jealous?” she said,
as he continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jealous of what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, of you and me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was pressing my hand again and endeavouring
to draw closer to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I’m rather afraid,” I said, “that he
may be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see,” said Miss Moonbeam, “if I’m
to be rescued by anybody, I should so like it
to be by you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Mary,” I said, “and so it shall, at
whatever cost, at whatever sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Augustus,” she said. “May I call
you Augustus? It sounds so ungrateful to say
Mr. Carp.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes,” I said. “I can quite understand
it. But I would rather you suppressed the
familiarity in public.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Ezekiel concluded, and after some
words from myself, a special meeting of the
Union was arranged, at which all our listeners,
including Miss Moonbeam, solemnly engaged
themselves to be present. It was to take place,
we agreed, on the following Sunday week, at
the Porter Street Drill Hall in Camberwell,
and at Miss Moonbeam’s suggestion, Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton was to be invited to say a few
words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I didn’t know you knew him,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor I do,” she replied. “But as he’s the
publisher of all these beautiful booklets, I
thought it would be so nice if he would just
stoop for a moment to mingle with the sinners
for whom they are intended.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A splendid idea,” I said, “and a most
intelligent one, and we’ll circularize the churches
and chapels, and hold the meeting at nine in
the evening, when the congregations will be
able to be present.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, that’ll be capital,” she said. “I should
love to see a congregation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Ezekiel and myself,” I said, “will be
the chief speakers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She clapped her hands and looked at Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Mr. Stool,” she cried, “what a meeting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ezekiel beamed at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it ought to be worth going to,” he
said, “and I shall reserve a chair for you next
the President.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she drew me aside again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you must have supper with me first,”
she said, “just you and me and a few of my
friends.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Mary,” I said, “nothing would
delight me more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel a whole new world,” she said, “opening
before me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the following Sunday week, therefore,
at half-past seven, I stood outside her house in
Bedford Square, and the next moment I was
being led upstairs by a modestly dressed
parlourmaid in a white cap. Clad myself in a
well-fitting morning coat with a hand-knitted
waistcoat and a velveteen tie, I found Miss
Moonbeam with her men and women companions
eagerly awaiting me in evening dress.
About a dozen in all, they included the naval
officer and two young men, whom she introduced
as her brothers, while there were several
females who greeted me with deference, but
whose chests, as I pointed out to them, were
inadequately covered. They begged my pardon,
however, with the not unreasonable excuse that
the standards I had set them were not easily
reached, and at my urgent request, Miss Moonbeam
provided them with napkins to make good
the deficiency. This having been attended to,
we then went downstairs to a capacious dining-room
on the ground floor, where an excellent
meal was ushered in with some admirably
prepared chicken soup.</p>

<p class='c014'>Followed by fish, partridges and salad, bowls
of stewed fruit and Devonshire cream, it was
concluded with a savoury consisting of stuffed
eggs mounted on triangular pieces of toast,
and I was gratified to observe that, apart from
water, the only other beverage was Portugalade.
It was again, to my annoyance, however, served
in wine glasses, although Miss Moonbeam immediately
apologized, pouring out a tumblerful
for me with her own hand, just as I was beginning
my second partridge. Nor did I find it
any less agreeable than upon my first acquaintance
with it at the theatre, and indeed I had
seldom experienced such a sense of warmth
and comfort as it very quickly began to endow
me with. Peculiarly attractive to the nostril,
it was no less grateful to the tongue, while upon
its downward passage, it lent an extraordinary
balm to a naturally irritable digestive system.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nay, it did more, for as it enriched the blood
mounting to an always responsive brain, I
found myself the vehicle of a delightful flow of
new and most valuable ideas. I say valuable,
and this was indeed the case, but many of them
were also outstandingly humorous, and time
after time I was obliged to call for silence so
that none of those present might fail to hear
them. I was glad to perceive, too, that they
met with an instant response both in laughter
and rapt attention, and I was soon convinced
that, beneath the trappings of guilt, there was
a spark of goodness in most of my listeners.
Nor had Miss Moonbeam, who kept my tumbler
filled, ever appeared to me to be so well worth
saving, and when I accidentally upset my fruit,
she was solicitude’s self as she wiped my
waistcoat.</p>

<p class='c014'>By a second mischance, too, I spilt my coffee,
which was served at the supper-table just before
we rose; and on this occasion also she was
instantly at hand to remove the stains from
the upper part of my trousers. Then we rose
for grace, which I proposed should be sung,
and into the singing of which I threw my
whole being; and when I found myself swaying
a little, owing to the consequent fatigue, both
she and the naval officer kindly supported me.
Indeed so acute was the resulting vertigo that
I was not only obliged for a moment to sit
down, but I found myself only too glad to rely
on their aid as we descended the front steps
to the waiting vehicles. Glad as I was, however,
they both assured me that they were
gladder even than I was, while the others
assured us, as we glanced across the pavement,
that they were gladder even than we were.
In fact we were all glad, and although I had
been a little perturbed by the physical disability
to which I have referred, I was soon
restored by the night air, the motion of the
vehicle, and the prospects of the meeting.
Moreover the naval officer had brought with
him a large bottle of the Portugalade, and a
further draught of this at once completed,
and indeed augmented, my sense of well-being.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it ought to be grand,” I said, “a grand
meeting, the grandest meeting we’ve ever had,”
and I remember putting my head out of the
right-hand window and inviting the passers-by
to come and join us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, there’s no doubt of it,” I said, “it’ll
be a grand meeting, a grand, grand meeting,
grander and grander.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As grand as grand,” said the naval officer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and grander than that,” I said, “ever
so grand.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I started a hymn just to clear my chest
again, and finding, to my satisfaction, that it
was surprisingly supple, I led my companions
through chorus after chorus of a brisk but
devotional character. Indeed we were in the
middle of one when we arrived at the Drill
Hall, and so intent had I become on the music
that I unfortunately tripped as I alighted upon
the pavement and struck my abdomen rather
violently. Two of Miss Moonbeam’s brothers,
however, who were waiting to receive us, at
once readjusted me upon my legs, while the
naval officer came to their assistance in conducting
me to my chair upon the platform.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor had I been in error in foreseeing an
audience that filled the hall to its utmost
capacity, Miss Moonbeam herself and several of
her companions being audibly recognized on their
way to their seats. Many of our members, too,
in different parts of the hall, were standing
on their feet, I noticed, to give me a personal
welcome; and no sooner had I hailed these in
affectionate terms than others took their places
to be hailed in turn. So prolonged, in fact, did
these greetings become, and to such a pitch of
heartiness did they climb, that Ezekiel’s own
arrival upon the platform, accompanied by
Mr. Chrysostom Lorton, was scarcely noticed.</p>

<p class='c014'>That was probably the reason, I inferred,
why his expression was almost less pleasant
than I had ever known it, and why he obviously
resented the attentions of Miss Moonbeam’s
brothers, who were still standing, one on each
side of me. Mr. Chrysostom, too, seemed
curiously distant, I thought, as I swung round
and clasped his hand, although I assured him,
in tones that rang through the hall, of my
intense delight at his presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Simply overwhelmed,” I said, “simply
overwhelmed, Mr. Chrysostom. Let me introduce
you to Miss Moonbeam. Miss Moonbeam,
Mr. Chrysostom Lorton. Mr. Chrysostom Lorton,
Miss Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I turned to the audience with a great
shout.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Three cheers,” I cried, “for Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton. Hip—hip——”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Ezekiel held up his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I propose to open this meeting,” he said,
“with prayer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I was staggered. Indeed I
almost fell down. It was the directest insult I
had ever received. And it was not only an
insult to myself, but to Mr. Chrysostom, who
was deprived of his cheers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, how dare you?” I cried. “How dare
you, Ezekiel? Oh, Mr. Chrysostom, how dare
he? Hip, hip, I say—Hip, hip,” but the audience
remained silent and evidently confused. In
fact the effect upon them of Ezekiel’s proposal
must have been exasperating in the extreme,
since they had all opened their mouths and
protruded their upper lips preparatory to cheering,
as I had suggested. They had then been
obliged, just as they had taken their breaths,
to retract their upper lips again and close
their mouths, and were naturally reluctant, in
spite of my further exhortation, to resume a
process once frustrated. Nevertheless many of
them did so, although they failed in its final
consummation, with the lamentable result that
they resembled nothing so much as goldfish
breathing in a bowl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Goldfish,” I cried. “That’s what they are.
Poor lost goldfish, without a shepherd. Oh,
Ezekiel, Ezekiel Stool! How could you do
such a thing as that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>With incredible determination, however, he
was already on his knees and in the second
paragraph of his supplication; and it was only
after I had shaken him several times that he
sprang to his feet with a sort of yelp.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Ezekiel,” I said, “what a horrible noise.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Leave me alone,” he snarled. “Can’t you
see I’m busy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Horrible noise,” I said, “horrible, horrible.
Isn’t it a horrible noise, Mr. Chrysostom?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I turned to the audience again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s say it all together,” I said. “One,
two, three, horrible noise. That’s better. Now
let’s say it again. One, two——”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I stopped abruptly, for as I advanced
to the brink of the platform, with Miss Moonbeam’s
brothers at my elbows, I suddenly
became aware of a solitary grey eye regarding
me objectionably from the front row. Its
fellow was of glass, and the face that contained
them, with its high cheek-bones and gaunt
cheeks, was that of none other than Mr. Archibald
Maidstone, the show-room manager whom
I had succeeded.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment I could scarcely believe it.
But hardly had I recovered myself than I found
myself in his arms, with Miss Moonbeam’s
brothers left upon the platform, each holding a
moiety of the tail of my coat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, laddie,” he said, “it’s your turn
now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I endeavoured to push myself away from
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take him away,” I shouted. “Take that
man away. Where’s Mr. Chrysostom? Where’s
Miss Moonbeam?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The tumult in the hall was now indescribable.
Glasses of water were on every side of me.
But I thrust them all aside and shouted to the
naval officer to bring me the bottle that he had
placed upon the table.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The bottle,” I cried. “Bring me the
bottle. Never mind the glass. Give me the
bottle.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But the naval officer, evidently at his request,
had handed the bottle to Mr. Chrysostom. I
saw him examine it through his spectacles in
his usual pompous and deliberate fashion and
then, with a heightened colour and protuberant
eyes, exhibit it to Ezekiel and the members of
the committee.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Disgraceful,” he said, “perfectly disgraceful.
The fellow’s drunk, I say. Just look at that.
Vintage Port, and he’s been drinking it out of a
tumbler. Perfectly disgraceful. Show me the
way out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I rose to my feet and caught sight of Miss
Moonbeam’s brothers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give me that bottle,” I cried. “Give me
the tails of my coat. Who says I’m drunk?
Where’s the Portugalade? Take that man
away. Where’s Miss Moonbeam?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But he’s my father,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to stare at her. But her face kept
advancing and retreating.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stand still, woman,” I cried. “But his
name’s Maidstone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So’s mine,” she said, “when I’m not
acting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I snatched at her wrist, but it proved to be
my own.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean to say,” I asked, “that you’re
Mary Maidstone?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Polly Maidstone,” she said. “Don’t you
remember? The same Polly that made a face
at you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sank to the floor for a moment, but rose
on my hands again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Throw her out,” I yelled. “Throw that
woman out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She looked at Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hadn’t we better take him home?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I haven’t made my speech,” I said,
“speech to the meeting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ezekiel stared at me with incredible bitterness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There isn’t a meeting left,” he said, “to
make a speech to.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I pointed at the clocks. They were all at half-past
nine.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But we’ve hardly begun,” I said. “Where’s
the platform?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Profound depression subsequent to port-poisoning. An
iniquitous plot and its consequences. Insubordination
of Miss Botterill. I retire from the firm of Mr. Chrysostom
Lorton. A crushing rejoinder and its repetition.
Second journey to Enfield. Transformation of Mrs.
Chrysostom’s boudoir. Unexpected repentance of Mrs.
Chrysostom. Unfortunate results of this for myself.
Fruitless termination of interview.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Such</span> was the cross that had suddenly been
imposed upon me—a cross so gigantic and of
such a character that only the most prolonged
and assiduous training could have enabled me
to bear it. Indeed, for some little time it seemed
only too likely that it would prove too crushing
even for me; and had not Nature intervened
with a period of merciful unconsciousness,
this would almost certainly have been the case.
Fortunately I arrived home, however, as my
father has assured me, in a deep though stertorous
slumber, and did not awake until nearly
eleven o’clock on the following Monday morning.
There was thus accorded me an opportunity
for the recuperation of those vital reserves
that would even then, as I slowly began to
realize, be desperately hard put to it to give
me adequate support.</p>

<p class='c014'>I say slowly because, when I first woke,
my physical nausea was so great that I was
totally unable to form a clear judgment upon
the events of the previous evening. Nor was
my mother, never a fluent speaker, more communicative
than usual. I had been brought
home, she said, by two young gentlemen, whose
names she did not know, and a doctor had been
called in, at my father’s request, who had made
a diagnosis with which my father disagreed.
Indeed my father, I gathered, had been considerably
upset, and had spent a restless night
in consequence, and my mother had been obliged
on three separate occasions to prepare him a
cup of malted milk. She then awaited my orders
for breakfast. But this was a meal that I was
compelled to omit. And it was only after she
had left me that my memory began to recover
itself and to lay its sombre offerings at the feet
of my judgment. Then I rang the bell again
and enquired of my mother the exact terms of
the doctor’s diagnosis. But she shook her head
and referred me to my father, who would be able
to tell me, she said, when he returned from
business.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not that it much matters,” she added, “for
you’d be sure to disagree with it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I certainly should,” I replied, “and I
certainly shall. I was poisoned—deliberately
poisoned—by the wicked woman with whom
I had my supper.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“An actress, I believe,” said my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whom I was prepared to save,” I said,
“from a deserved perdition.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is that all?” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you mean, all?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I mean, may I go now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, yes,” I said. “Shut the door
quietly, please; and I should like my shaving
water in about an hour.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I lay back quietly, closing my eyes in
pain and rehearsing such speeches as would be
necessary to put both Mr. Chrysostom Lorton
and Ezekiel Stool in the full possession of the
facts of the case. It would also be essential, I
foresaw, to call a further special meeting of the
Anti-Dramatic and Saltatory Union and to
make a point of addressing, at the earliest
opportunity, the Society for the Prevention
of the Strong Drink Traffic. It would be equally
important too, in my capacity of gap-filler, to
prepare an explanatory petition for use at the
local prayer-meetings, the majority of which
had contributed members to last night’s audience
in the Porter Street Drill Hall. Yes, it was all
coming back to me in its devilish ingenuity
(for it had evidently been a plot on the part
of Mr. Maidstone’s daughter), and she might
depend upon it that if legal redress were possible,
it should be extracted from her to the last
farthing.</p>

<p class='c014'>But was it possible? The more I considered
it, the more doubtful I became. And even
were it possible, would it be expedient? The
condition of my head forbade an immediate
answer. Indeed I was now the subject of a
thirst so overwhelming that without pausing
to summon my mother, I was obliged to quench
it from the various receptacles within easy
reach upon my wash-hand stand. I was profoundly
shocked, too, by the aspect of my
countenance, as this was disclosed to me by
my looking-glass; and accustomed as I was to
a frequently concealed tongue, I had never
before seen it so deeply obscured. Even after
I had shaved and dressed, indeed, I was a little
doubtful as to whether I should be able to complete
the journey to town. But I was determined
if possible not only to make the attempt,
but to perform my usual afternoon duties.
After a cup of tea therefore, and a fragment
of dried herring, I ventured into the street and
mounted an omnibus, arriving in Paternoster
Row at about two o’clock to find Miss Botterill
in charge of the show-room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good afternoon,” I said. “I have been
the victim of a dastardly plot, or I should have
been in my place this morning as usual.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good afternoon,” she replied, “and please,
Mr. Chrysostom said, would you go up to his
room as soon as you arrived.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly,” I said, “and when I come down,
Miss Botterill, I should like to see that counter
looking a little tidier.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Botterill hesitated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m just rearranging it,” she said. “I
propose in future to have it less crowded.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You propose what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I propose in future,” she said, “to have
a bowl of flowers upon it and merely a very few
of our latest books.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Depleted as I felt, I yet retained command
of myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Miss Botterill,” I said, “permit
me to remind you that your duty is to obey
and not propose. You will therefore kindly
restore the counter to its previous appearance
and remember in future that you are not show-room
manager.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I am,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She continued her rearranging.</p>

<p class='c014'>Deprived of breath, I could only stand and
watch her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I leapt forward and gripped her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, how dare you?” I cried. “How dare
you, woman?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She began to scream. But I declined to let
her go until several of the clerks had emerged
from the correspondence room. Then I flung
her from me heavily, turned upon my heel,
and instantly proceeded to Mr. Chrysostom’s
office. He was standing at the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s all this screaming?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I regret to say,” I replied, “that Miss
Botterill has been insubordinate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Insubordinate?” he said. “And to whom,
please?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To myself,” I replied, “as your representative.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then kindly understand,” he said, “kindly
understand, sir, that after last night——”</p>

<p class='c014'>I waved my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One moment,” I said. “It is to explain
about last night that I have managed to force
myself to come and see you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He distended his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you could have spared yourself the
trouble,” he said. “I don’t want to see your
face again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear sir,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m not your dear sir,” he shouted. “I’m
not your dear anything. I’ve no further use
for you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But I held up my hand again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must beg you to control yourself,” I said,
“until this unfortunate mishap has been fully
explained to you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mishap?” he said. “Do you call it a
mishap, sir, to invite your employer to a religious
gathering and leave him to be received by a thing
like a stunted gorilla, because you’re too drunk
to stand by yourself?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear sir,” I began.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t say that again,” he said. “Don’t
say anything again. I don’t want to hear it.
You were drunk, sir. You were damnably
drunk. You were so drunk that you fell off
the platform.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Involuntarily I winced, as who would not
have done? But once more I held up my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Lorton,” I said, “you have forgotten
who I am, or such words could never have escaped
you. And I was neither drunk, nor would have
such a thing have been possible. I was merely
suffering from deliberate port-poisoning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>If anything, however, he became more violent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Port-poisoning?” he bawled. “What’s
port-poisoning? Port isn’t poison, sir. I drink
it myself. In fact I was obliged, sir, to drink
some of your own—an excellent port, sir,
that probably saved my life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I regret to hear it,” I said. “But allow
me to point out to you that the fluid you mention
was not my own, and that I had been informed
by its donors that it was a species of fruit squash,
imported from Portugal and known as Portugalade.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, good God, sir, there’s no such thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Precisely,” I replied. “That’s my point.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your point?” he cried. “What do you
mean by your point?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, that I was refreshed,” I said, “and
subsequently disabled by a beverage that has
no existence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you’re a fool,” he said. “You’re
either a knave, sir—a drunken knave—or a
fool.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then am I to understand,” I said, “that I
am no longer show-room manager?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re no longer anything,” he said, “in
any business of mine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I leaned against the wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you call yourself a Xtian gentleman?”
I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I certainly do,” he said, “and I thank God
for it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I stood erect again, dashing the tears
from my eyes. He pulled out his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t wet me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was inadvertent,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m glad to hear it,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And I apologize,” I said, “to the moisture.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment he gaped at me, and little
wonder. It was perhaps the crushingest remark
in human history.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I apologize,” I said, “to the moisture.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Yes, it must have cut him to the quick.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was so crushing, indeed, that I repeated
it to Miss Botterill.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Botterill,” I said, “I am leaving.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” she said. “I knew before
you came.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“May I beg,” I replied, “that you won’t
interrupt me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was silent and I continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And one of my tears,” I said, “fell on Mr.
Chrysostom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear,” she said. “Poor Mr. Chrysostom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So I apologized,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quite right,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But not to Mr. Chrysostom,” I said. “I
apologized to the moisture.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To the moisture?” she said. “What
moisture?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, to the moisture,” I explained, “of
the tear.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She stared at me with her mouth open.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what was the good of that?” she asked.
“The moisture couldn’t hear you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No. It couldn’t hear me,” I said, “it
couldn’t hear me, Miss Botterill. But don’t
you see that by apologizing to the moisture, I
was conveying to Mr. Chrysostom, in the most
trenchant way possible, my own opinion of his
character.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I don’t,” said Miss Botterill. “I
don’t see it at all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I’ll explain it,” I said, “over again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just at that moment, however, a customer
entered the show-room, and although I waited
for several minutes, another customer entered
the show-room just as the first was departing.
I therefore decided to leave the premises,
spurning them, as I did so, with my right foot,
and it was not until I had already turned into
Ludgate Hill that I suddenly remembered my
unused weapon. Mrs. Chrysostom Lorton—I
had utterly forgotten her. Indeed I had never
seen her since my first interview. But she had
always been there, of course—there in the background—ready
to be used in an emergency
like this. I stopped short. Yes, I had forgotten
her. But to have remembered her was to act
at once. For there could be no doubt about it.
It would be wholly impossible for her to afford
to sit still and have me dismissed. I therefore
advanced to the kerb-stone and hailed an omnibus,
and within half an hour of conceiving the
idea was in a third-class carriage leaving Liverpool
Street Station upon my second visit to
Enfield. Depressed as I was, too, both physically
and mentally, in spite of my crushing
rejoinder to Mr. Chrysostom, my spirits perceptibly
rose as I neared my destination,
stimulated by the memory of my previous
triumph. For though a good many years
had now elapsed since I last stood in that
lascivious boudoir, Time had not dimmed the
spiritual victory that it had been my privilege to
gain there.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was with an eye, therefore, comparatively
clear that I once more approached Paternoster
Towers and with a hand almost steady that I
again knocked at its front door. Nor was
the strange parlourmaid that received my card
and presently conducted me to Mrs. Chrysostom’s
room appreciably less respectful in her
demeanour than the gentle domestic that had
first received me. But the room itself, apart
from its floor, which was now almost lecherous
in its degree of polish, was so transformed that
for several moments I could scarcely believe
myself in the same apartment. Gone was the
French-looking writing-table with its reflected
legs. Gone was the nude huntress with the
splinter in her calf. Gone was the oval mirror
with its indelicate Cupids. Gone even was the
photograph signed Your aff. Chrysostom. Nay,
gone was the very couch with its sensuous
cushions, and in its place stood a low divan,
padded it was true, and not uncomfortably,
but cushioned and draped with the sombrest
purple.</p>

<p class='c014'>There hung upon the walls, too, what were
apparently lists of commandments, engraved
upon parchment in foreign characters, while
in each angle of the room stood a sort of shrine
containing an alabaster image and an electric
candle. Moreover, although it was still daylight,
the curtains were drawn; a casket of incense
swung from the ceiling; and between the lists
of commandments, hung various religious implements,
phylacteries, wands, and sacrificial
knives.</p>

<p class='c014'>Profound, and indeed disturbing, however,
as were the changes in the room, those in Mrs.
Chrysostom were even more remarkable, although
in actual appearance she had altered very little
since I had last been obliged to interview her.
It was just conceivable, in fact, that for less
disciplined eyes she might still have retained
a certain attraction, not unenhanced by the
severity of her gown and the sober arrangement
of her hair. Parted at the side, this now
fell over her brow in a single yellowish-coloured
wave, while her dark dress—it was still clinging,
I noticed—was unadorned in every respect.
Her whole mien, too, was entirely different,
and as she drooped, as it were, into the room,
she extended her hand to me with a sort of
grave surprise, as if I had been some stranger
whom she had never seen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you do?” she said, sinking upon
the divan. “This is my little temple. Won’t
you sit down?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I glanced about me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t offer you a chair,” she said. “But
you’ll find my prayer-mat just behind you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just as I put my heel upon it, however, it
began to slip, and leaning over, she put her finger
upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me hold it,” she said, “while you lower
yourself. I once had a visitor who lost two
of his trouser-buttons.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was myself,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She looked at me steadfastly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely,” she said, “I haven’t seen you
before?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed to her gravely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You certainly have,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She lifted her eyebrows a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But can that be possible?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not only possible,” I said, “but it
actually happened.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her tapering forefinger touched my knee.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then forgive me,” she said, “but, if I
may venture to say so, hasn’t Time been
exceedingly kind to you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t quite follow,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, of course not,” she said, “your modesty
would forbid it. But I can scarcely conceive
that, if such had not been the case, I should
have failed to remember you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course I have matured,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She nodded imperceptibly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is what I meant,” she said. “I
think you must have.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it is rather about the future,” I said,
“than the past that I have been obliged to call
upon you this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her eyes became dreamy, although they were
still fixed upon me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, the future,” she said, “the unknown
future.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you will be sorry to hear,” I said,
“that owing to a misunderstanding, Mr. Chrysostom
has requested me to leave.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean my husband?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, of course,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Chrysostom,” she said. “This is
some of his hair.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She showed me a small locket containing
the article mentioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am compelled to remind you,” I said,
“that you were not always so affectionate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, that’s true,” she said, “that’s very
true. But happily I also have matured.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at her again, a trifle uneasily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then perhaps you have forgotten,” I said,
“your friend Septimus?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Completely,” she said. “Was there one?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Had the floor been less slippery, I should have
risen to my feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Septimus Lorton,” I said, “your husband’s
brother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mean the one,” she said, “that’s just
passed on?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Passed on?” I replied. “Where to?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She waved her hands towards several of the
shrines.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, if we but knew,” she said, “if we but
knew, Mr. Carp.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But do you mean to tell me,” I cried, “that
he’s defunct?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Run over,” she said, “last week.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment, I must confess, I was a little
taken aback.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But that doesn’t alter the fact,” I said,
“that he was your lover.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very likely not,” she said. “I don’t
remember. But I daresay you’re right. There
have been so many.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But do you mean to say,” I asked, “that
there has been more than one?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh far, far more than one,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I began to rise again, and she put her finger
on the mat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me hold it,” she said, “while you get
up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This she did, and after a certain amount of
difficulty, I once more towered above her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But your husband?” I said. “Does your
husband know?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Everything,” she said. “In fact, all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I took a deep breath, followed by another.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what did he say?” I asked at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>She closed her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m afraid I oughtn’t to tell you,” she said.
“You see, since then I’ve embraced religion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Religion?” I said. “What religion?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every religion,” she said. “I’ve embraced
them all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how could you do that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, there was no difficulty,” she said.
“It has always been natural to me to embrace.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I glanced round the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But certain religions,” I said, “involve the
slaughter of human beings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” she said. “I’ve included
them. That’s why those knives are hanging
on the wall.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely you don’t practise them?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, they’re cancelled out,” she said, “by
the religions that forbid the taking of life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it seems to me,” I said, “that, at that
rate, all your religions cancel each other out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” she replied. “That’s what it often
seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But then you haven’t a religion at all?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I sometimes doubt it,” she said.
“I often wonder if I did the right thing in embracing
them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was not to discuss her religion, however,
that I had journeyed to Enfield, as I was now
somewhat tartly obliged to remind her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you seem to be forgetting,” I added,
“that I’ve just been dismissed from the employment
you were compelled to find me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know,” she said. “But why should
I remember it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because you might prefer,” I said, “to get
the decision altered.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She lifted her eyes to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Prefer it to what?” she enquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, to permitting your husband,” I said,
“to hear from my lips the story of your relations
with his brother Septimus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, but I don’t mind that,” she said, “now
that I’ve repented. And besides, as I told you,
I’d forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With growing uneasiness, I took another deep
breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely you’re not prepared,” I said,
“to let me tell him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On the contrary,” she said, “I should
welcome it, though I doubt if it would interest
him after all the others.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I began to sway a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Mrs. Chrysostom,” I said,
“if you behave like that, I shall remain dismissed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely, Mr. Carp,” she answered, “and
I can see you’re a good man, it’s the only
behaviour consistent with repentance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I pulled out my handkerchief and wiped my
forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you wouldn’t speak a word,” I asked,
“on my behalf?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She shook her head gently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is one of my rules,” she said, “never to
interfere with dear Chrysostom’s business.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I glanced round the room again. My hat
was on one of the shrines.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you haven’t yet told me,” she said,
“that you’re glad I’ve repented.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I am,” I said. “I am glad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I mustn’t detain you,” she said.
“Mind the polish.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Physical reaction following my interview with Mrs. Chrysostom.
Reception of a wreath from the Maidstones.
Moving excerpt from Simeon’s diary. I decide to marry
one of Ezekiel’s sisters. Interview with Ezekiel and his
deplorable language. Tact is selected to become my
bride. Tragic return to Mon Repos. I fall unconscious,
parallel to my father.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Glad</span> as I was, however, and indeed, as a Xtian
gentleman, glad as I was compelled to be that
Mrs. Chrysostom had repented, it was nevertheless
a penitence that in respect of myself
was little short of disastrous. And even now
it is with the utmost difficulty that I can look
back upon the weeks that followed. Deprived
of my living; already nearing thirty; and the
subject, as I soon found, of the grossest misjudgment—such
was my prostration that for
nearly three weeks, I was confined to my bedroom,
if not to my bed. For two or three days,
in fact, I doubted if I could recover, a doubt
that was shared by my dear father; while a
small wreath, sent by the Maidstones, was
actually delivered at the house. Whether this
was despatched under a misapprehension;
whether it was the symbol of a genuine contrition;
or whether it was merely a sop to an
uneasy conscience, will probably never be determined.
And I refrained from acknowledging
it until I had come to a decision as to the possibilities
of legal action. After a prolonged
interview, however, with Mr. Balfour Whey,
and in view of my poor father’s unhappy
experiences, it was regretfully decided that the
British judiciary was too uncertain to be relied
upon; and in a brief sentence, therefore, at
the beginning of a letter, I informed Miss
Maidstone of its safe arrival. The remainder
of the letter, of which I still have a copy, was
perhaps the severest exposure of a female
character that has ever been penned, with the
possible exception of certain passages in the
Book of Revelation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another document, of which I have a copy,
and which was also indited by me, while in bed,
was rendered necessary by the widespread
local confusion between acute port-poisoning
and ordinary inebriation—a confusion accentuated,
and indeed never wholly dispersed,
owing to the despicable attitude of Mr. Chrysostom.
Thanks to the generosity, however, of
my kind friend Simeon Whey, who had not been
present at the meeting, I was enabled to print
several hundreds of these for personal and
vicarious distribution, agents being posted, upon
the following Sunday, at the doors of St. Nicholas,
Newington Butts, and, during the ensuing week,
at the exits and entrances of all my habitual
haunts of prayer. In so far as I knew their
addresses, too, the pamphlet was sent by post
to the members of the <i>A.D.S.U.</i> and <i>S.P.S.D.T.</i>,
and to such other persons as might reasonably
have been presumed to have been present at
the Porter Street Drill Hall.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the most part, however, I lay for long
hours either comatose or actually asleep, all
my meals being brought to my bedside and
consumed in a semi-recumbent posture. Nor,
had they come, should I have been able to receive
visitors, although I made an exception in favour
of Simeon Whey, who bicycled from Balham
every Wednesday and Saturday, not only as a
friend but also as a clergyman. Indeed in many
ways I found his ministrations more soothing
than those of my father, who had transferred
both his bible and the harmonium from the
parlour downstairs to my bedroom. His voice,
however, though still very powerful, was much
more uncertain than it used to be, and I was
usually obliged, after about three-quarters of
an hour, to ask him to desist from further
vocalization.</p>

<p class='c014'>So the days passed, one after another, and
each a little longer than the one before; and
although I endeavoured to summon, and I trust
not unsuccessfully, the whole of my accumulated
spiritual reserves, it was only by an effort
that many would have judged superhuman
that I began almost imperceptibly to regain
my strength. Indeed, to at least one observer
the spectacle I was now presenting was so
fractionally short of a miracle that, as he wrote
in his diary (for it was none other than Simeon)
it “will never cease to be an inspiration to me.”
But let me quote the whole passage, written
after I had been in bed for about a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-day,” he wrote, “I have again visited
my poor friend, Augustus Carp, who is still
laid aside on the bed of complete exhaustion
as the result of the deception that I have already
described; and more than ever, as I perceived
him lying there, did I regret my absence from
the meeting in question. Visibly flushed,
although this may perhaps have been due to
the imperfect absorption of a recent meal, his
eyes were focussed upon a point in the ceiling
with an almost tragic intensity, and the mute
endurance with which he awaits the future will
never cease to be an inspiration to me. Nor
will he fail, as it seems to me, to need it. For
with his chief means of sustenance rent away
from him, it will probably become obligatory
for him, as he has faintly whispered to me, to
marry one of the sisters of Ezekiel Stool.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That is the whole passage, and I have thought
well to include it not only as an encouragement
to the afflicted but also as an indication of the
poignant decision to which I was now slowly
being forced, for, as I had instantly feared on
leaving Mrs. Chrysostom, and as I had since
perceived, alas, only too distinctly, I was face
to face with just such a catastrophe as marriage
with a Stool had been kept in reserve for. Nor
had I been able to discern, bitterly though I
had sought for it, any practicable alternative—or
none that would preserve me from the personal
indignity of applying for fresh employment
without adequate references.</p>

<div id='i256'  class='figcenter id009'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>The twin sisters of Ezekiel Stool. The right-hand one became my wife</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Any such employment, too, even if I were to
obtain it, would inevitably be associated with
a loss of income that would seriously cripple me
in those fuller religious duties for which I was so
evidently being prepared. For this at any
rate had become abundantly clear to me—and
indeed it was the sheet anchor by which I
clung to life—that I could not but emerge from
such an abyss of suffering enormously the richer
in strength of character. More than ever,
therefore, would it be desirable in future not
only that I should be immune from financial
anxiety but that I should have at my disposal
a larger amount of leisure for my more sacred
avocations. Indeed, if this were possible, I
felt that henceforward I should be entirely
freed from the necessity for money-making,
and thereby liberated for the completer uplifting
of all with whom I might be brought into
contact.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such then were the conclusions to which I
had been driven, and which I would already
have communicated to Ezekiel, had the latter
visited me on what Simeon has so well described
as the bed of complete exhaustion. Since I
had been carried from the meeting, however,
to Miss Maidstone’s vehicle—it was her two
brothers who had borne me home—I had neither
looked upon Ezekiel’s face nor received a message
from his lips; and this in spite of the fact that
I had sent him six of my pamphlets for his own
use and that of his sisters. I therefore decided,
when I had accumulated sufficient strength—and
this was not for another fortnight—to
visit him in my own person, though naturally
I did so with considerable reluctance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor can I say that I was agreeably impressed
either by his reception of me or his subsequent
attitude, in which I could not but detect a good
deal of that arrogance lately so manifest in his
character. It was quite clear, however, that
the subject of my errand did not take him by
surprise, and indeed he assured me, almost at
once, that he had been expecting it for some days.
He then remained silent with his back to his
fire and continued to stare at me rather offensively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mind,” I said, “if I sit down?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not at all,” he replied. “You can do as you
please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I therefore did so, but so distant was his manner
that it was difficult to reconcile it, as I immediately
pointed out to him, either with his duty
as a Xtian or his privileges as an host.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In fact, you appear to have forgotten,”
I said, “though I pray I may be wrong, that I
was once the means of saving your life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He breathed unpleasantly through his right
nostril.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very possibly,” he said. “But to what
end? To the deliberate ruination of the <i>A.D.S.U.</i>
and all my prospects of marrying Miss Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Ezekiel,” I began.</p>

<p class='c014'>He interrupted me coldly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must beg you in future,” he said, “to
call me Mr. Stool.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Call you Mr. Stool,” I gasped, “after all
these years of impassioned friendship?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He waved his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I repudiate them,” he said. “I repudiate
them in their entirety.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew myself up to a right angle with my
lap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Mr. Stool,” I said, “surely you must
realize the enormous magnitude of your escape?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Escape?” he said. “Escape from what?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, from the wickedness,” I replied,
“that I have been the means of revealing to
you in the bottomless depths of Miss Moonbeam’s
heart.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He blew away the hair from before his lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I shouldn’t have been marrying her
wickedness,” he said. “I should have been
marrying herself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Herself?” I cried. “But you don’t mean
to tell me that you were attached to her as a
female?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I do,” he said. “Intensely. I was
intensely attached to her as a female.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But then, if you had married her,” I said,
“it wouldn’t have been a sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you know?” he said. “How do
you know it wouldn’t?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, because you’d have liked it,” I said.
“You’d have liked marrying her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, of course,” he replied. “And some
people like sacrificing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Mr. Stool,” I began, “now
that her wickedness has been revealed to
you——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t care a damn,” he said, “about her
wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Had I been stronger, I should have leapt to
my feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t care a what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A damn,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A damn?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, a damn,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c014'>I leaned back, closing my eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and I’ve said worse things.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I opened them again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve said bally and hell and blow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He paused for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And I’ve said blast. That’s the sort of
man, Mr. Carp, that you’ve turned me into.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear Mr. Stool,” I said, “as your
future brother-in-law——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. But I’m not at all sure,” he said,
“that you will be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Had I been erect, I should certainly have
fallen. And indeed, as it was, I barely retained
consciousness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, Ezekiel,” I cried, “Mr. Stool, surely
you haven’t forgotten your word of honour.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I haven’t,” he said. “I haven’t.
But then you were a man without moral stain.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And am I not now?” I asked. “Am I not
now, Mr. Stool? Is the victim soiled by the
criminal’s guilt? Is the pioneer, drawn from
the morass, responsible for his temporary discoloration?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was silent for a moment, but in so far as
it was visible, his expression was far from reassuring.
Then he rang the bell, and Tact entered
the room. She was the less attractive of the
two twins.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s the one,” he said. “I made them
draw lots. But you can only marry her on one
condition—that you sign an agreement to live
north of the Thames and make a home for her
four sisters.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He tilted his chin a little and put his hands
in his pockets. A distant dog barked three
times. With a supreme effort I clung to my
senses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean all,” I whispered, “including
Faith?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Faith was the least attractive of the three
triplets.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All or none,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>He pulled out his watch.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could hear it ticking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why did you do that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m giving you a minute,” he said, “in
which to decide.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Faint though I was, I staggered to my feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then as a Xtian,” I said, “no less than a
gentleman——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thirty seconds,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll take her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He replaced his watch, and I took Tact’s
hand. All the female Stools have poor circulations.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So we’ll be getting married,” I said, “in
due course.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” she said. “That’ll be very nice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then her four sisters, who had evidently been
waiting outside, came and shook hands with me
with expressions of delight, and Ezekiel informed
me that his solicitor would be in attendance
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed a little stiffly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall be here,” I said, and Ezekiel replied
that he had no doubt of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I shook hands again with Tact and
her sisters, bidding them good-bye for the
present; and they bade me good-bye, also for
the present, adding that they would be seeing
me to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, to-morrow,” I said. “I’ll be seeing you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then we’ll say good-bye,” they said, “till
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, till to-morrow,” I said, “to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then we’ll say good-bye,” they said, “till
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor did I fail to keep the appointment,
though little did I dream, as I groped for the
door, that not even yet had I been called upon
to face the ultimate temperature of my refining
fire. For hardly had I arrived, somewhat
fresher than I expected, at the garden gate
of Mon Repos when there staggered up to it a
railway omnibus, congested to the limit of
its legal capacity. Deformed with luggage
and distended with females, a single glance was
sufficient to paralyse me, though less on my own
account than on that of my father, who now
stood transfixed on the doorstep. Then he
gave a small cry of the extremest pathos, and
as my mother’s eight sisters descended to the
pavement, he fell forward upon the garden
path, never to rise again.</p>

<p class='c014'>But it was too much even for me, shaken as
I had been to my very foundations, and turning
my back and covering my eyes from that
hurrying, Welsh-speaking female flood, I fell
forward parallel to my father, though with my
head in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c003' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Commencement of my life’s afternoon. My father’s eight
sisters-in-law return to Wales. Astounding attitude of
my mother. Physical effect thereof on myself. I move
to Stoke Newington. Further parochial activities.
Simeon Whey obtains a living. I move to Hornsey and
become a Churchwarden. Complete decline of Ezekiel
Stool. Birth of my son. A happy augury.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Yes</span>, I fell down; Nature could stand no more;
and a discerning Providence, relenting at last,
mercifully granted me a moment’s oblivion
while my mother’s eight sisters swept over me.
But I was never to be the same man again;
and I have always regarded that unconscious
moment as definitely conducting me into what
has happily proved the long afternoon of my
life. For it must not be thought that I am
repining, or that, looking back over the intervening
years, I am anything but grateful for
that final ordeal, through which my character
was required to pass. On the contrary—<i>post
tenebras lux</i><a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a>—as I have often remarked
to my wife and her sisters, I can only thank
Heaven that I was considered worthy of so
prolonged and fierce a discipline.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f16'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After darkness light.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Nor do I propose, as I now turn, in this the final
chapter of my book, to the quiet contemplation
of the fruitful activities with which my later
life has been concerned—nor do I propose, I say,
to linger unduly over the tragic incidents just
recorded. Defeated in their object by what
I have since been informed was the rupture of
an important cerebral artery, my father’s eight
murderesses—for such in fact they were—were
obliged to return again to Llanpwhllanpwh,
though not until they had compelled me, on
pain of attending his funeral, to purchase their
tickets out of my father’s estate.</p>

<p class='c014'>Much more difficult, however, was the problem
of my mother, who had thus unexpectedly
survived her husband, and for whom I was
therefore obliged, as I had promised my father,
to make some sort of provision. This was the
more harassing, too, in that my father’s savings
had been practically obliterated by his law costs,
thereby reducing my own inheritance to the bare
sum for which he had been insured. Further
diminished by an iniquitous taxation, the settlement
of bills, and the expenses of his interment,
I was thus faced, in respect of my mother, with
a singularly annoying predicament—and this
at the very moment when my attention was
fully occupied with the details of my wedding.
Great was my satisfaction, therefore, when my
fiancée, with an intelligence as welcome as it
was unexpected, suggested that my mother
should continue her previous functions in the
house that we had procured at Stoke Newington.
She would thus not only be assured of food and
shelter, but would enjoy the additional satisfaction
of enabling us to dispense, in our new
home, with the paid services of a cook.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A good idea,” I cried, “an excellent idea,”
and I remember Tact’s pleasure when I gave
her a kiss. So astounding, however, was my
mother’s reception of the plan that I was obliged
to sit down for several minutes, while the scene
recurred to me in the form of a nightmare on
at least three occasions during the following
fortnight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said my mother. “I’m very sorry,
Augustus. But my future arrangements won’t
permit of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stared at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your future arrangements?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” she replied. “I’m going to take a
holiday.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was then that I sat down.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take a holiday?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, a holiday,” she said. “Don’t you
think it’s time?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear mother,” I said, “what do
you want a holiday for?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, just to see,” she replied, “what it’s
like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt the blood rush to my cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear mother,” I said, “I can’t
consent to that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She folded her hands, not very agreeably.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I’m afraid,” she said, “that I shall
have to go without.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go without?” I asked. “But you can’t.
You haven’t any money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She smiled a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, I have,” she said. “Quite sufficient
for my purpose.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bent forward for a moment, struggling for
breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sufficient for your purpose?” I asked.
“But where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I’ve always saved a bit,” she said,
“and taken good advice, and I bought an
annuity yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“An annuity?” I repeated. “You’ve saved
enough for that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and a little more,” she said, “to play
about with.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, my dear mother,” I said, “what did
you save it out of?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Out of my housekeeping money,” she said.
“I made it rather a hobby.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I rose to my feet again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then what it amounts to,” I said, “is
that you’ve been robbing my poor father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think not,” she said, “though you can
consult Mr. Balfour Whey, of course. But you
must remember that I’ve had no wages.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wages?” I cried. “But you weren’t a
servant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, that’s true,” she said. “I was only a
wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And a mother,” I reminded her. “You
seem to forget that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not at all,” she replied. “I remember it
distinctly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at her sternly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then am I to understand,” I asked, “that
you entirely refuse to accept my offer?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I’m afraid so,” she said. “I’m going
to Paris, and then to a little place on the
Riviera.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I resumed my seat rather heavily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To Paris?” I said. “But you don’t know
the language.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Pas trop</i>,” she said, “<i>mais ça suffit</i>. And
besides, I shall be staying with Emily Smith.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Totally unmanned, I wiped my forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I thought she was in service,” I said,
“in Aberdeen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother smiled again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, no,” she replied. “She’s running an
hotel near Bordighera.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, as the room rocked, I clutched at the
arms of my chair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m feeling unwell,” I said. “I’m going
to be sick.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I was afraid,” said my mother, “that
you might be. You oughtn’t to have eaten
quite so much dinner.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus with a heartlessness only the more
incredible in view of the atmosphere with which
she had been surrounded, my mother withdrew
from her son’s life, needless to say never to
re-enter it; and we were consequently obliged
to procure a professional cook at a not inconsiderable
monthly wage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Apart from this, however, after a satisfactory
wedding service, adequately conducted by the
Reverend Simeon Whey, the earlier years of
my matrimonial life may be passed over without
particular comment. Subject to my agreement
with Ezekiel, who was now deteriorating almost
every day, I had obtained, as I have said, a
house at Stoke Newington, within easy distance
of St. Gregory’s Church. Here, like my father,
I soon made myself a sidesman, and within
three or four months of joining the congregation,
I had become the means of distributing the
parish magazine in Longfellow Crescent and
Byron Square. From that it was but a step
to auditing the accounts of the Band of Hope
and the Additional Blanket Fund, and in a very
few years I was perhaps the most prominent
figure in the parochial life of St. Gregory’s.
Nor must it be supposed that I had entirely
severed myself from all my previous regenerative
interests. From the Anti-Dramatic and Saltatory
Union it was true that I had deemed it
better to resign, and indeed this body, lacking
the support of Ezekiel, concluded its activities
shortly afterwards. But I still retained my
membership of the Non-Smokers’ League, and
for some years have been its deputy chairman,
while I had had myself transferred, on moving
to Stoke Newington, to the Dalston Division
of the <i>S.P.S.D.T.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps the happiest day, however, of this
period of my life, and the one that finally led me
to my present abode, was the October Saturday
on which I heard from Simeon Whey that he
had obtained the living of St. Potamus, Hornsey.
As this was only achieved after long years of
practically ceaseless struggle, he wept in my
arms, I remember, for nearly an hour, my wife
and her sisters adding contributory tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor will my happiness,” he said, “be complete—kck—until
I have seen the name of
Augustus Carp publicly inscribed—kck—on the
church notice board, as one of the churchwardens
of my parish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without delay, therefore, I resolved to transfer
my worship to the church presided over by
my friend, and within six months, I had obtained
the ten years’ tenancy of Wilhelmina, Nassington
Park Gardens. This I have since renewed,
and as sidesman, churchwarden, Sunday School
superintendent and secretary of the Glee Club,
no less than as President of the St. Potamus
Purity League, I could scarcely have done
otherwise. And indeed I rather fear that were
I to suggest leaving, I should be forcibly prevented
by my fellow-parishioners. My wife
and her sisters, too, as they have frequently
told me, have never regretted leaving Camberwell,
slightly disturbed, as they have occasionally
been, by the acute decline of their brother
Ezekiel.</p>

<p class='c014'>They have seldom seen him, however, and
then but accidentally, and as for myself I have
only met him once, when I chanced to encounter
him at the entrance of the Albany, where, as
I understood, he then had chambers. Completely
shaved and evidently massaged, he was
flicking a particle of dust from his left coat-sleeve,
and on catching sight of me, he surveyed
me through a monocle with a thin gold chain
and a tortoiseshell rim.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hullo, Carp,” he said. “Taxi,” and a taxi
being present, I was spared from replying.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor have I been denied—albeit it was not
until a year ago that Providence saw fit to
reward my efforts—the crowning satisfaction
of becoming the father of a small, but still
surviving, boy; and the happiest auguries,
I think, can safely be discerned in the circumstances
surrounding his birth. Indeed so amazingly
similar were these to those ushering in
my own that I cannot do better, perhaps,
than close this volume with a scene from which
my readers, I hope, will derive as intense a joy
as that which was conferred upon myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Born at half-past three on a February morning,
the world having been decked with a slight
snow-fall, it was then that the trained nurse
in attendance on the case opened the bedroom
door and emerged on the landing. I had gone
outside to lean over the gate, and was still
leaning there when she opened the door, but
Faith and Hope, with Simeon Whey’s housekeeper,
were standing with bowed heads at
the foot of the stairs. Prone in the parlour,
and stretched in uneasy attitudes, Charity and
Understanding were snatching a troubled sleep,
while two female members of the St. Potamus
Purity League were upon their knees in the back
kitchen. But for the fact indeed that Charity
and Understanding had slight impediments
in their noses, the whole house would have been
wrapped in the profoundest stillness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Simeon Whey’s housekeeper was the first to
see the nurse, though she only saw her, as it
were, through a mist. The nurse was the first
to speak in a voice tremulous with emotion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s Mr. Carp?” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s just gone outside,” said Simeon Whey’s
housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c014'>Something splashed heavily on the hall
linoleum. It was a drop of moisture from the
nurse’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell him,” she said, “that he’s the father
of a son.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Simeon Whey’s housekeeper gave a great
cry. I was beside her in a single leap. Always
highly coloured, I have since been assured that
my face seemed literally on fire. The two
fellow-members of the St. Potamus Purity
League, accompanied by Charity and Understanding,
rushed into the hall. The nurse
leaned over the banisters.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A boy,” she said. “It’s a boy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A boy?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, a boy,” said the nurse.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a moment’s hush, and then Nature
had its way. Unashamedly I burst into tears.
Simeon Whey’s housekeeper kissed me on the
neck just as the two fellow-members burst
into a hymn; and a moment later, Charity and
Understanding burst simultaneously into the
doxology. Then I recovered myself and held
up my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall call him Augustus,” I said, “after
myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Or tin?” suggested Simeon Whey’s housekeeper.
“What about calling him tin, after
the saint?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you mean tin?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Augus-tin,” said Charity.</p>

<p class='c014'>But I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, it shall be tus,” I said. “Tus is better
than tin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Charity and Understanding resumed the
singing, from which the two fellow-members
had been unable to desist, until after rapidly
thinking, and coming to a further decision, I
once again held up my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And I shall give Simeon Whey,” I said,
“the first opportunity of becoming Augustus’s
godfather.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I took a deep breath, threw back my
shoulders, tilted my chin, and closed my eyes;
and with the full vigour of my immense voice,
I too joined in the doxology.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
